This work aims to: describe an ongoing hospital-based systematic search (SS) of occupational LC; improve aetiological diagnosis; increase number and quality of LC notifications. Through a short form, physicians at a public hospital referred incident LC to the Occupational Health Unit (OHU). Only patients selected through the form were interviewed; a personal, occupational and clinical history was collected; reports were sent to the ward and Local Health Authority, with aetiological diagnosis criteria and probability of causation. From 1998 to 2013, 3274 cases of LC were notified to the OHU; prior to the system, just couple of dozens were assessed. A total of 1522 patients were fully interviewed; in 395 cases, causation was attributed to occupation (26 % of interviewed patients); all were notified to authorities, as compared to the handful reported before the system was adopted. Main aetiological agents were silica, asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, truck driving, painting, multiple exposures. Compensation rate was remarkable (39 %). Through SS, many occupational LCs were found that otherwise would have been lost. Aetiological diagnosis proved to be rich of scientific advantages and practical implications, with attention to equity and social aspects. SS was easy, accountable and fostered multidisciplinary collaboration among medical specialties, significantly reducing underreporting and undercompensation of occupational LC.";1432-1246;-1;pubmed, embase;1332, 1073;1;;1;1

We show that, under this definition, even the average probability of causation among exposed cases is not identifiable from epidemiologic data. This is because the probability of causation depends both on the unknown mechanisms by which exposure affects disease risk and competing risks, and on the unknown degree of heterogeneity in the background disease risk of the exposed population. We derive the maximum and minimum values for the probability of causation consistent with the observable population quantities. We also derive the relationship of the 'assigned share' (excess incidence rate as a proportion of total incidence rate) to the probability of causation.;0006-341X;-1;embase;1262;0;;1;2

II: Practical attempts;363-374;64;6;Aim of the study: To determine the respective role of each of multiple exposures in the occurrence of a disease such as bronchial cancer. Are the probability of causation and apportionment useful when occupational exposure is associated to non-professional exposure? Method: From uses in several countries for various exposures, the method of probability is applied to bronchial cancer and asbestos exposure taking into account smoking habits. For multiple exposures, the apportionment of the risks had to be calculated. Results: The apportionment is necessary to analyse the respective risks related to multiple exposures taking into account the dose-response relationships and the interactions. Smoking plays a major role in the occurrence of lung cancer. Thus the risks induced by smoking cannot be neglected nor be an automatic reason to exclude an occupational origin. The probability of causation for multiple exposure and apportionment for multiple exposures are based on scientific knowledge and can be used to establish guidelines of consistent criteria for recognition of occupational disease. In France, stepwise decision tree and apportionment might be useful for the Comités régionaux de reconnaissance des maladies professionnelles. However, these statistical methods arise theoretical, practical, ethical problems. They may be used in only few cases because of the uncertainties of the dose-response relationships, of the interactions between substances and of the quantifications of individual exposures.;1250-3274;manual_review;embase;1185;0;;1;3

A national advisory committee has a key task of providing advice on the protocols for operationalisation of individual causality assessment in this new context. Protocol development involves gathering the best available population-level evidence on causality and using this evidence to determine individual causality. Here, the presumably plausible principle was adopted, which stipulates that uncertainties in individual causality should be weighed in favour of a fast and transparent one-time compensation for (ex-)workers. In monocausal diseases, a limited workplace exposure assessment is considered sufficient to determine whether individual causality is presumably plausible in the Dutch context. For multicausal occupational diseases, individual causality assessment is more complicated. Modelling of existing data on the exposure-response relation helps establish the probability of causation, that is, the risk of the disease attributable to a work-related exposure. This operationalisation, applied in some protocols, makes use of the probability of causation, while being prudent in establishing exposure limits. An example from asbestos and lung cancer is provided in this short report. We propose a pragmatic approach to individual causality assessment of substance-related occupational diseases, considering statistical and diagnostic uncertainties. This approach substantiates protocols towards a one-time financial compensation without long-winding recognition procedures.;1470-7926;-1;pubmed, embase, openalex;1290, 1008, 1699;0;;1;5

ProZES calculates this probability, the assigned share, for solid cancers and hematopoietic malignant diseases, in cases of exposures to low-LET radiation, and for lung cancer in cases of exposure to radon. User-specified inputs include birth year, sex, type of diagnosed cancer, age at diagnosis, radiation exposure history and characteristics, and smoking behaviour for lung cancer. Cancer risk models are an essential part of ProZES. Linking disease and exposure to radiation involves several methodological aspects, and assessment of uncertainties received particular attention. ProZES systematically uses the principle of multi-model inference. Models of radiation risk were either newly developed or critically re-evaluated for ProZES, including dedicated models for frequent types of cancer and, for less common diseases, models for groups of functionally similar cancer sites. The low-LET models originate mostly from the study of atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Risks predicted by these models are adjusted to be applicable to the population of Germany and to different time periods. Adjustment factors for low dose rates and for a reduced risk during the minimum latency time between exposure and cancer are also applied. The development of the methodology and software was initiated and supported by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) taking up advice by the German Commission on Radiological Protection (SSK, Strahlenschutzkommission). These provide the scientific basis to support decision making on compensation claims regarding malignancies following occupational exposure to radiation in Germany.;1432-2099;-1;pubmed, embase, openalex;1310, 1034, 1578;0;;1;6

Med;10.1186/s40557-018-0220-5;Probability of causation for occupational cancer after exposure to ionizing radiation;;30;1;Background: Probability of causation (PC) is a reasonable way to estimate causal relationships in radiation-related cancer. This study reviewed the international trend, usage, and critiques of the PC method. Because it has been used in Korea, it is important to check the present status and estimation of PC in radiation-related cancers in Korea. Methods: Research articles and official reports regarding PC of radiation-related cancer and published from the 1980s onwards were reviewed, including studies used for the revision of the Korean PC program. PC has been calculated for compensation-related cases in Korea since 2005. Results: The United States National Institutes of Health first estimated the PC in 1985. Among the 106 occupational diseases listed in the International Labor Organization Recommendation 194 (International Labor Office (ILO), ILO List of Occupational Diseases, 2010), PC is available only for occupational cancer after ionizing radiation exposure. The United States and United Kingdom use PC as specific criteria for decisions on the compensability of workers' radiation-related health effects. In Korea, PC was developed firstly as Korean Radiation Risk and Assigned Share (KORRAS) in 1999. In 2015, the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute and Radiation Health Research Institute jointly developed a more revised PC program, Occupational Safety and Health-PC (OSH-PC). Between 2005 and 2015, PC was applied in 16 claims of workers' compensation for radiation-related cancers. In most of the cases, compensation was given when the PC was more than 50%. However, in one case, lower than 50% PC was accepted considering the possibility of underestimation of the cumulative exposure dose. Conclusions: PC is one of the most advanced tools for estimating the causation of occupational cancer. PC has been adjusted for baseline cancer incidence in Korean workers, and for uncertainties using a statistical method. Because the fundamental reason for under- or over-estimation is probably inaccurate dose reconstruction, a proper guideline is necessary.;2052-4374;-1;embase;1060;0;;1;7

Low Radiat;10.1504/IJLR.2014.063411;Health monitoring of NPP workers;274-288;9;4;The aim of the study is to assess the health status of Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant personnel in association with their occupational exposure to low doses of ionising radiation (IR) as well as with other factors of their working environment and to determine the probability of the occupational exposure to be a reason for the diagnosed malignant diseases (Probability of Causation - PC). More than 1000 occupationally exposed workers and nonexposed administrative staff have been studied during 1993-2008. No statistically significant variation in the average cumulative dose was found between the healthy people and the persons with at least one disorder. The highest rate of morbidity was registered in persons with doses up to 1 mSv. The analysis of parameters of peripheral blood showed that at occupational lowdose exposure the haemopoietic system completely preserves the tri-linear cell proliferation capacity of the bone marrow. The analysis of results of PC demonstrated that this is spontaneously arising malignant diseases, regardless of condition of work.

For each case of lung cancer the probability that it was caused (probability of causation (PC)) by coal tar pitch volatiles was expressed as an increasing function of cumulative exposure to benzo-a-pyrene-years. This was assessed from several exposure-response models fitted to data from a large epidemiological study of aluminum production workers. For some models, PC depended also on the smoking habit of the cancer patient. Estimation of relative risk by exposure group indicated that over 50% of lung cancers were attributable to coal tar pitch volatiles (PC > 50%) at exposures above 100 micrograms/m3-years benzo(a)pyrene. A linear relative risk model indicated that 50% PC was first achieved at 342.2 micrograms/m3-years benzo(a)pyrene, or 190.1 micrograms/m3-years benzo(a)pyrene according to the upper 95% confidence limit for risk increment. Corresponding figures for a power curve model were 210.3 and 45.9. With these five figures as compensation criteria compensation would have resulted in 31.4%, 2.7%, 19.2%, 15.7%, and 39.2% of cancers studied, compared with an estimated total proportion of cancers studied attributable to coal tar pitch volatiles of 15%-26%. If risks due to coal tar pitch volatiles and smoking multiply, PC does not depend on the amount smoked. If the two risks are additive, however, PC depends on the amount smoked according to a formula, with the figures mentioned applying to an average smoking history (24.4 pack-years). Because of its simplicity and because it falls within the range of criteria based on several more sophisticated approaches, we prefer the criterion of 100 micrograms/m3-years, based on the relative risks by exposure group. However, the compensation board of the Canadian province of Quebec, on consideration of these alternatives, has proposed as a criterion that the upper 95% confidence limit of PC for the patient be at least 50%, assuming an additive relative risk model and allowing for their smoking habit.;1351-0711;-1;pubmed, embase;1434, 1227;0;;1;9

A comparison between atomic bomb survivors and uranium miners;279-285;60;4;Excess lung cancer risk has been associated with exposure to alpha particle radiation from inhaled radon daughter products among uranium miners in Czechoslovakia, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere, and with exposure to gamma rays and neutrons from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. Differences in distribution by histological type, as well as certain epidemiological differences, suggest the possibility of differences in the causation of radiation-induced lung cancer. An epidemiological analysis is summarised of results from a blind pathology panel review of tissue slides from lung cancer cases diagnosed in 108 Japanese A bomb survivors and 92 American uranium miners selected on the basis of radiation exposure, smoking history, sex, age, and source and quality of pathology material. Consensus diagnoses were obtained with respect to principal sub-type, including squamous cell cancer, small cell cancer, adenocarcinoma, and less frequent sub-types. The results were analysed in terms of population, radiation dose, and smoking history. As expected, the proportion of squamous cell cancer was positively related to smoking history in both populations. The relative frequencies of small cell cancer and adenocarcinoma were very different in the two populations, but this difference was adequately accounted for by differences in radiation dose (more specifically, dose-based relative risk estimates based on published risk coefficients). Data for the two populations conformed to a common pattern, in which radiation-induced cancers appeared more likely to be of the small-cell sub-type, and less likely to be adenocarcinomas. No additional explanation in terms of radiation quality (alpha particles or gamma rays), uniform or local irradiation, inhaled as against external radiation source, or other population differences, appeared to be required. One possible interpretation of the finding is that radiation-related lung carcinogenesis may depend heavily on interactions with inhaled promoter/progressor agents, such as smoke. Thus, even though ionising events from external gamma rays and inhaled radon decay products are very differently distributed within the lung, the spatial distribution, and cell types, of any resulting cancers may be determined largely by the action of other agents deposited within the bronchi.;0144-8420;-1;embase;1237;0;;1;10

Diagrams of the excess relative rate per 100 working level months in its dependence on age at exposure and age attained are shown to be a useful tool to elucidate the influence that is due to the choice of the model, and to assess the differences between the data from the major western cohorts and those from the Czech uranium miners. It is seen that the influence of the choice of the model is minor compared to the difference between the data sets. The results are used to derive attributable lifetime risks and probabilities of causation for lung cancer following radon progeny exposures.;0017-9078;-1;pubmed, embase;1447, 1241;0;;1;11
