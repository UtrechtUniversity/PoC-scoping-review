This work aims to: describe an ongoing hospital-based systematic search (SS) of occupational LC; improve aetiological diagnosis; increase number and quality of LC notifications. Through a short form, physicians at a public hospital referred incident LC to the Occupational Health Unit (OHU). Only patients selected through the form were interviewed; a personal, occupational and clinical history was collected; reports were sent to the ward and Local Health Authority, with aetiological diagnosis criteria and probability of causation. From 1998 to 2013, 3274 cases of LC were notified to the OHU; prior to the system, just couple of dozens were assessed. A total of 1522 patients were fully interviewed; in 395 cases, causation was attributed to occupation (26 % of interviewed patients); all were notified to authorities, as compared to the handful reported before the system was adopted. Main aetiological agents were silica, asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, truck driving, painting, multiple exposures. Compensation rate was remarkable (39 %). Through SS, many occupational LCs were found that otherwise would have been lost. Aetiological diagnosis proved to be rich of scientific advantages and practical implications, with attention to equity and social aspects. SS was easy, accountable and fostered multidisciplinary collaboration among medical specialties, significantly reducing underreporting and undercompensation of occupational LC.",1432-1246,-1,"pubmed, embase","1332, 1073",1,,1,1

In this study we wanted to look at work relation, reporting and compensation for newly diagnosed cases of lung cancer Method The aim of the study was to interview newly diagnosed lung cancer patients about occupation and exposures at work. The relation between lung cancer and occupation was established for each patient as probably, possibly or not probably occupational. The patients were counselled about possibilities for compensation. The number of reported cases in the project period from all health regions in Norway to The Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority was assessed, and information about granted compensation among the study participants was collected from The Norwegian Labour and Welfare Administration (NAV) Results We interviewed 105 lung cancer patients, 73 men and 32 women. Among men 16% were diagnosed as probably and 22% as possibly occupational. No cases among women were judged as occupational. From the different health regions in Norway 1,7-5,1% of lung cancers were reported as occupational. Among the patients who applied for compensation 9 out of 11 with probable and 5 out of 12 with possible ocupational disease were granted compensation from NAV Discussion Attributable fraction for male lung cancer is about 20%. The proportion of patients with work related disease in our study is of the same magnitude. The underreporting of occupational lung cancer is considerable. In the diagnostic approach to lung cancer an assessment of the patient's occupational exposures is often forgotten.

The case of diesel engine exhaust.,540-542,79,8,"Regulators frequently deviate from health-based recommendations when setting occupational exposure limits, but the impact on workers' health is rarely made explicit. We present a quantitative evaluation of the expected impact of recently proposed regulatory limits for occupational diesel engine exhaust (DEE) exposure on the excess burden of lung cancer (LC) in Europe. We used a lifetable approach, basing our analyses on the DEE exposure distribution in a large general population study, as well as the 5% prevalence used in earlier DEE burden calculations. We evaluated the effects of intervention on DEE exposures according to a health based limit (1 ug/m3 of elemental carbon (EC)) and both Dutch (10 ug/m3) and European (50 ug/m3) proposed regulatory limit values. Results were expressed as individual excess lifetime risks (ELR), total excess number of cases and population attributable fraction of LC. The ELR for the EU working population was estimated to be 341/10 000 workers based on our empirical exposure distribution and 46/10 000 workers based on the 5% prevalence. Implementing the proposed health based DEE limit would reduce the ELR by approximately 93%, while the proposed regulatory limits of 10 and 50 ug/m3 EC would reduce the ELR by 51% and 21%, respectively. Although the proposed regulatory limits are expected to reduce the number of DEE related LC deaths, the residual ELRs are still significantly higher than the targets used for deriving health-based risk limits. The number of additional cases of LC in Europe due to DEE exposure, therefore, remains significant.",1470-7926,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1300, 1022, 1643",,,,3

Allergic contact dermatitis was the most prevalent diagnosis, while all respiratory disease accounted for 39% of the recognized occupational morbidity. These figures in part corroborate our results published in Occupational Medicine in 2005 [2]. Dr Kourouklis declared that occupational diseases in Greece are underreported due to the absence of a unified recording and notification system covering all insurance schemes and we agree that all schemes in the country should have a common notification system. The problem is that even if other schemes replicated the figures provided by IKA, the annual incidence rate of 0.39 recognized occupational diseases/100 000 employees would not change. Thus, the establishment of a common notification system for is only a part of the problem. Dr Kourouklis has mentioned that the renewal of the prescribed list could be a first step towards improvement of the reporting and notification of occupational diseases. We agree with him, but again the renewal of the prescribed list per se does not solve the problem of underreporting and the undiagnosed burden of occupational morbidity in Greece. An illustrative example is pleural mesothelioma that was not included in the prescribed list until 2005 and only one case of pleural mesothelioma was recognized in 2001 [2] despite the country's major asbestos industry in the past. This is also is the case for lung cancer and a Greek case–control study revealed that exposure to occupational carcinogens including asbestos was associated with an attributable risk of lung cancer 9.9–16.6% [3]. The question is why do these figures suggest under-registration of occupational disease in Greece? As well as the low number of specialized occupational physicians, problems with the notification system and renewal of the prescribed list, there are more fundamental reasons for this situation. The system of insurance coverage for occupational risk has a variety of limitations and often the main target of employers is simply to demonstrate compliance with health and safety legislation. There are no reference centres for the diagnosis and management of occupational diseases as there are for instance in the UK and occupational health and safety has received low priority in the Greek political and public agenda [4]. We feel that the current model of occupational health in Greece has exhausted all its potential for development and the under registration of occupational morbidity reflects the state of occupational health in our country.",0962-7480 1471-8405,abstract_added,openalex,1637,,,,9

Hegmann",2018,Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine,10.1097/jom.0000000000001492,Work-Relatedness,e640-e646,60,12,"INTRODUCTION Physicians are frequently requested to determine whether putative risk factors—occupational or nonoccupational—caused an injury, disease, or disorder; therefore, a valid and reproducible method to analyze the available clinical information, epidemiological evidence, and exposure data should be used to determine causation. This determination is not only important to evaluate an individual patient, but also other workers who may be similarly exposed. Interventions to improve the safety of workers by mitigating or eliminating these exposures should be evidence-based. Determination of work-relatedness can determine financial compensation, including past and future expenses of treatment, vocational rehabilitation, permanent or partial disability benefits, and diminution of earning capacity.1,2 Because the legal standard for determining work-relatedness may vary jurisdictionally, physicians must be aware of the relevant definition of work-relatedness. Although the legal basis for work-relatedness often differs between jurisdictions, the scientific method for determination of causation or apportionment among occupational, nonoccupational, and personal risk factors remains consistent. The distinction between establishing medical causation and legal causation is critical: Medical causation is determined by scientific criteria establishing a causal association between an injury, illness, disease, or disorder and known risk factor(s). Legal causation is determined by criteria established by legal authority. These criteria vary among jurisdictions. Although the crux of this guideline is the determination of medical causation, a few examples of legal causation follow. Pursuant to the common law of negligence, proximate cause (legal cause) is the primary cause, or that which in a natural and continuous sequence, uninterrupted by any intervening cause, produces injury, and without which the result would not have occurred. An injury is proximately caused whenever a defendant's negligence actually caused the injury, and the injury was either the direct consequence or a reasonably foreseeable consequence of that negligence. Statutory schemes may redefine the conventional common law definition of legal cause. Under the Federal Employers Liability Act, which applies to interstate railroad carriers, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the railroad's negligence was the proximate cause, in whole or in part, of plaintiff's injury. Courts have construed this statutory language to require mere proof that a railroad's negligence proximately caused a worker's injury, even to the slightest degree. This same lenient standard applies to actions prosecuted under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the ""Jones Act""). Pursuant to worker's compensation statutes, state legislatures may create presumptions concerning work-relatedness that establish rights and liabilities, even in the absence of medical causation. Such presumptions almost universally favor a determination of work-relatedness, but are rebuttable by competent contrary evidence. Rarely, agencies may enact a rebuttable presumption that a condition is not work-related. For instance, a state might establish an irrefutable presumption that lung cancers are work-related if they occur among firefighters; accordingly, the development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma by a firefighter would be presumptively work-related. Conversely, a legislature may create a presumption that the development of lung cancer among firefighters who have at least a 10 pack-year cigarette smoking history is not work-related. Consequently, even a firefighter with significant workplace exposure to a known carcinogen would be presumptively not work-related, if the firefighter's smoking history meets the minimum criterion. Workers' compensation systems may also weight the opinions of providers differently. A treating physician's causation opinion, regardless of qualifications, may supersede that of a consulting physician with specific subject matter expertise; therefore, the court may disregard a consulting physician's opinion and rely on the treating physician's opinion, irrespective of either the treating physician's qualifications or the rigor of his or her methodology for determination of causation. DETERMINATION OF CAUSATION In evaluating traumatic injuries, the etiology of which is not in dispute (eg, fracture or dislocation), or the acute occurrences of disease (eg, acute carbon monoxide toxicity), may not demand the same rigorous evaluation of work-relatedness as an occupational disease. Establishing the causality of disease may be difficult, especially if it is necessary to determine whether an employee's disease was caused by, or alternatively, aggravated by an occupational exposure. In contrast to a traumatic injury, a cause–effect relationship between disease and an occupational exposure may not be clear. Occupational diseases may develop insidiously. Symptoms of disease may be confused with age-related symptoms or effects caused by other relevant factors—personal health attributes or avocational exposures. Information on prior occupational exposures is often unavailable, inadequate, or incomplete. Individual susceptibility to similar exposures to disease-producing agents may influence causation decisions. Avocational exposures may be either a primary or contributory cause. Clinical evaluations frequently commence with a presumption of work-relatedness, a cursory determination of work-relatedness, or even no evaluation of work-relatedness. Under certain circumstances, clinicians may be concerned primarily with accurate differential diagnosis and prescription of efficacious treatment.3 However, what appears to be obvious is often subject to controversy, particularly in compensation environments; accordingly, it is important to compile complete and accurate information, if possible, to assure an equitable work-relatedness decision. An inability to identify a nonoccupational cause for the subject condition (eg, an avocational exposure or personal health attribute) should not result in a default conclusion that the adverse health effect is work-related. GENERAL AND SPECIFIC CAUSATION Epidemiological evidence establishing that a risk factor is generally capable of causing the plaintiff's adverse health outcome is insufficient evidence that an individual's adverse health consequence was specifically caused by the exposures of interest. For example, evidence of an inadvertent chemical release into the ecosystem, coupled with epidemiological evidence of a causal association between such chemicals and the subject disease, is insufficient evidence that the release caused an adverse health consequence, absent evidence that the individual was exposed to a sufficient magnitude of exposure to the chemical to cause the adverse health effect; the temporal (chronological) relationship between exposure and effect is biologically plausible; and other known and biologically plausible causes have been excluded. PRIMARY CF. MULTIFACTORIAL CAUSATION The physician may determine that a workplace factor is the primary cause or one of several contributory causes (ie, multifactorial). Each factor could either independently produce a disease or disorder, or there may be a synergy among multiple factors. A direct cause can generally be attributed if both an immediate trauma and the effect are clearly observable. If an obvious and direct relationship exists between an injury and an external energy source, such as a moving or falling object (kinetic energy), a fall (potential energy), a chemical burn (chemical energy), or an electric shock or radiation (electromagnetic energy), a sole direct cause exists. Health conditions often develop due to a combination of factors, only some of which may be work-related. For instance, hearing loss may occur as a result of aging, cardiovascular disease, and occupational noise exposure. Additionally, occupational and nonoccupational factors may have a synergistic effect (eg, carpal tunnel syndrome developing in the context of simultaneous exertional job requirements, obesity, and diabetes mellitus). Cases may also develop following exposures arising from both nonoccupational and work-related activities. Personal factors also can be part of the ""web of causation."" For example, there is evidence that wrist width-depth ratio is a risk for carpal tunnel syndrome.4–6 In these circumstances, physicians are obliged to assess whether causality is truly multifactorial or whether there is a predominant cause among many factors. Competing causation differs from combined causation in that either a workplace factor or a nonoccupational factor, but not both, is independently responsible for the adverse health effect. For example, because pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, thyroid disorders, tobacco, and repetitive forceful motions have been independently associated with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), a patient with diabetes who does very little forceful, repetitive work will most likely develop carpal tunnel syndrome due to the diabetes, not occupational exposure.7–18 In both primary and multifactorial causation, it is essential to attain a thorough understanding of the patient's exact work activities, as well as to compare the work activities with exposures reported in the quality epidemiological literature and metrics established by exposure standards, eg, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), International Organization for Standardization (ISO), American National Standards Institute (ANSI), and the World Health Organization (WHO) standards and guidelines). Identifying a condition in coworkers may be informative (particularly when the outcome is rare) in assessing competing and combined causation. For instance, bronchiolitis obliterans among popcorn workers or other diacetyl-exposed workers markedly increases the probability of a causal linkage. When disorders are common and multifactorial, identifying other workplace cases may be meaningful, especially when adjusted rates are valid and statistically elevated. For example, where there are elevated rates of CTS, consideration of occupational and nonoccupational factors permits physicians to understand both the operant biomechanical factors and assess whether the effects are manifest among coworkers, in addition to the patient, although at lesser levels (suggesting combined causation) or limited predominantly to the patient (suggesting competing causation with nonoccupational factors of greater significance than occupational factors). PRIMARY CF. CERTAINTY For medical purposes, different definitions of causation are used depending on the purpose of the assessment of work-relatedness. In the clinical setting, relatively specific case definitions are used to define occurrence (as described further in the ACOEM guidelines for individual conditions). In clinical practice, action based on the assessment of causal association and on the seriousness of the health effect may be commensurate with the degree of certainty about causation, based on available information on temporal, physiologic, and physical links between exposure and effect. In such cases, analytic reasoning not opinion should be used to link the populations-based epidemiological evidence with clinical findings and exposure data (see Independent Medical Examinations and Consultations guideline); otherwise, preventive efforts are unlikely to be effective. From a public health perspective, a reasonable probability of causation should lead to preventive actions whenever possible. Physicians can weigh the costs and benefits of the intervention against the degree of certainty of causation (eg, an ergonomics evaluation of a worksite could be triggered by worker complaints of discomfort; whereas, removing a worker from a job generally requires more study and associated certainty). In contrast, bronchiolitis obliterans in a diacetyl-exposed worker should prompt a rapid analysis and preventive interventions. The physician's opinion on the absolute probability that a disease or disorder is work-related should not be affected by administrative or legal context; however, a statement of probability related to compensability must incorporate both the absolute probability as well as the administrative or legal context. The term ""more likely than not"" (equal to or greater than 51%) is a legal and not medical term that must be used as defined and intended. Disorders presented for causal analysis might represent reoccurrence of a previously resolved condition or exacerbation (ie, aggravation) of a pre-existing condition. The distinction between a recurrence, or aggravation of a condition is medically and legally important. Substantial confusion has been engendered by the ambiguous and inconsistent use of such terminology in worker's compensation statutes, which seldom operationally define such terms. Aggravation could be construed as manifestation of symptoms, exacerbation of symptoms, or a progression, natural or otherwise, of underlying pathology. Aggravation and exacerbation are synonymous. Precipitation could be construed as manifestation, natural or otherwise, of underlying pathology, whether previously recognized or not. Importantly, modulation of symptoms as the result of occupational exposures is characteristic of both occupational and nonoccupational injuries and diseases. Manifestation of symptoms coincident with occupational activity does not necessarily infer work-relatedness or persistence of ""disability."" Acute trauma can be superimposed on prior work-related and nonwork-related conditions. If an underlying condition is aggravated, it is important to document the impairment due to the aggravating factors. Restoring prior activity levels is a principle goal of treatment. When and if that objective is achieved, the aggravation is deemed to have resolved. Because an aggravation of a pre-existing condition has, by definition, led to a permanent alteration in the patient's underlying condition, the work-related injury or disease is not cured. Regardless of whether a full return to work occurs, there remains a potential for future recurrence of symptoms. Should symptoms recur, it may, depending upon the workers' compensation laws involved, be necessary to determine whether recurrence is due to an aggravating incident or exposure or the natural progression of the pre-existing condition. TYPES OF CAUSATION ANALYSIS A provisional causation analysis is generally conducted during or immediately after the first clinical encounter. Although the physician is advised to ascertain exposure, information may still be incomplete or inaccurate especially in compensation settings.1,19–22 However, a provisional opinion as to causation may be necessary in many jurisdictions to initiate appropriate treatment measures and to determine whether workers' compensation or other benefits will be provided, even if causation has not yet been definitively determined. The definitive case analysis is often conducted after reaching a conclusive diagnosis, obtaining considerably more information about individual exposures, and obtaining prior and detailed medical history. Analyzing other pertinent medical information and scientific literature is often necessary. An epidemiologic causal analysis, based on patterns observed in populations of workers, will be important in most instances. DETERMINING WORK-RELATEDNESS—METHODOLOGY The approach to the determination of work-relatedness, as published by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH),23 consists of adaptation of the following six-step process: Evidence of disease. What is the disease? What certainty is there that the diagnosis is correct? What evidence supports or fails to support that diagnosis? Is the diagnosis supported using a generally accepted case criteria definition? Epidemiology. What is the epidemiological evidence for that condition? Is there support for a relationship with work? Evidence of individual exposure. What objective evidence is there that the level of the patient's exposure is of the frequency, intensity, duration, and temporal pattern of exposure associated with work-relatedness? Consideration of other relevant factors. What other potentially causal factors are present? For example, is the worker with carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) pregnant or obese? Validity of testimony. Are the opinions and sources reliable and credible? If an expert opinion has been rendered, is the person professionally qualified to render that opinion? Is there verification for the basis of the testimony, that is, the importance attributed to various areas of the information reviewed, and the conclusions that were drawn? Is there information that suggests that the information above is inaccurate, for example, from a collateral source (eg, exposure data)? Conclusions. This step is a synthesis of the above five steps. This provides a basic process to follow; however, evaluation of the specific evidence available is critically important and requires a disciplined process itself.24–26 EVALUATING THE EVIDENCE For epidemiologic surveillance, a highly sensitive, relatively nonspecific case definition is frequently employed. This may increase the rate of screening yield for study, but generally produces a high rate of false-positives. If surveillance results suggest cause and effect, more formal research can be done to carefully evaluate and better test an apparent association. The epidemiologic research-study definition of causal association is much more rigid, traditionally implying 95% confidence that the purported causal relationship is not statistically spurious. Quality scientific literature about toxicological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, and other occupational disorders defining causal associations with work exposures is frequently lacking, making it difficult to predict whether risk factors statistically associated with or predictive of certain adverse health consequences [or outcomes] are, in fact, causal associations.27–30 The methodology for inferring a causal association is provided in Table 1.TABLE 1: Steps for Evaluating Epidemiological Evidence of a Causal AssociationCRITERIA FOR THE EVALUATION OF EPIDEMIOLOGIC EVIDENCE The epidemiologic and public health communities have generally accepted criteria to assess the evidence for the work-relatedness of adverse health effects. These criteria should guide recommendations for preventive measures to evaluate the possible effects of exposures for individuals and groups. See Table 1. The first four of the following criteria are generally considered the most important: Temporal association between the exposure or work factor and the health concern (ie, the exposure necessarily precedes the development of disease). Strength of the association (eg, how large is the relative risk or odds ratio comparing exposed to unexposed workers?). Dose–response (ie, biological gradient) demonstrating progressively increasing risk estimates across at least three levels of exposure). Consistency of the association among multiple epidemiological studies. Coherence of the association with existing physiologic data, trends in exposure levels over time, and other knowledge. Specificity of the association demonstrating that the exposure causes one specific health outcome, rather than a nonspecific group of unrelated outcomes. Plausibility of the purported exposure-disease relationship Reversibility (eg, that the tissue abnormalities resolve with cessation or reduction of exposure). Experimental evidence from animal models. Predictive performance of the association in predicting future cases of the disease. Physicians must be specific about the frequency, intensity, duration, and temporal patterns of purported exposures that might be associated with a specific adverse health outcome. BASICS OF CAUSATION ANALYSIS If the ostensible (or purported) causal factor's effect on the patient is immediate and visible (eg, a burn), imputing causation is straightforward. Otherwise, imputing causation to a given physical, biological, or chemical work factor requires credible epidemiological evidence that a purported observation of work-relatedness is ultimately causally associated with an individual's exposure). The co-existence of the exposure and effect is necessary, but not sufficient. CAUSALITY INITIAL ASSESSMENT—MECHANISM Although a provisional assessment is often conducted based on limited facts, it must be conducted carefully as it affects subsequent care, compensability, and state and federal injury recording (eg, federal OSHA injury recording regulations). Information needed to reach a definitive analysis may be available at the time of the first visit, but obtaining additional information is almost always necessary. The minimum initial assessment of causality, for preventive purposes, may be based on a well-informed initial assessment; however, the degree of uncertainty should be clearly communicated to the patient, employer, state or federal agency. The objectives of the initial clinical assessment are to: Determine a diagnosis according to specific diagnostic criteria including reported symptoms, clinical signs, and objective diagnostic criteria; Evaluate potential causative workplace exposure factors; Assess the potential impact (s) of a compensation environment; and Assess whether other causal factors are likely. The initial contact with the patient is usually the best time to acquire time sensitive or unbiased information. The patient's memory of acute events is most accurate immediately following an event. Information needed for the definitive analysis of causation often comes from other sources or is found in medical or employment records, according greatest weight given to the most proximate records. HISTORY (INITIAL AND INTERVAL) A careful medical history is essential to consideration of the work-relatedness of a complaint. It emphasizes the organ system (s) that is the focus of the presenting complaint or thought to be the target of the exposure. This includes the elicitation of a description of activity levels, limitations, and symptoms before and after an occupational exposure. This information can provide insight into possible occupational, nonoccupational, psychological, socioeconomic, and premorbid factors that might influence function (ie, global functional response to an injury, disease, or disorder). It is also necessary to obtain a psychiatric history in situations where the patient presents with psychiatric, stress-related, chronic, or recurring complaints. Neuropsychological testing is often necessary when there is a failure of or inadequate response to therapy, interventions, and/or removal from exposure. One link between exposures and health effects is their temporal relationship. The temporal exposure and trauma and symptoms onset should be documented. Although the onset of subacute or chronic conditions may be gradual, time estimates should be established. Particular attention should be paid to ascertaining and recording whether the exposure always preceded never followed the onset of symptoms. Although less important, the presence and severity of symptoms overnight, on weekends, on holidays, or other times that the patient is not ""exposed,"" should be critically examined. Determining temporal causality might be difficult for chronic diseases and disorders and certain psychiatric problems. For example, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder may be delayed temporally for quite some time relative to the cause of the trauma; and osteoarthrosis symptoms often modestly improve over weekends or other periods of nonexposure to physical factors; yet, prescribed activity is actually therapeutic, and the relationship between osteoarthrosis and work factors is tenuous. Workplace exposures need to be objectively quantified by valid and reliable methods. The patient may describe his or her typical workday and any unusual events preceding the onset of symptoms; however, self-reported information concerning both exposure and symptoms is not necessarily reliable in compensation environments.1,19–22 Unusual events might include changes in workload, in physical or chemical processes, the absence or breakdown of engineering controls, or personal protective equipment. The inquiry includes relevant personal habits (especially substances use, tobacco, alcohol, prescription medications (eg, opioids), and others with adverse health effects), coexisting disease states, and family history. The patient should also be asked about similar occupational or nonoccupational problems and their resolution in the past. Nonwork activities should be assessed, particularly regarding the patient's participation in second jobs, recreational activities or hobbies that could precipitate similar symptoms or hinder their resolution. When taking a worker's history, the goal should be to answer: Was there a temporal relationship between the exposure and alleged effect? (Did the work exposure occur before the health effect?) If so, was the time that elapsed between the exposure and its putative effect consistent the epidemiological evidence, considering the nature of the exposure (temporal contiguity)? Was the amount (frequency, intensity, durations, and temporal patterns) of the exposure sufficient to cause an effect in most workers? If not, was the amount of the exposure sufficient to cause an effect in this particular worker (ie, does the worker have any immunological sensitization)? Does the association with work fit logically with previous biologic or statistical evidence as to how the symptom or disorder could develop (termed the coherence of the association)? Other specifics of the case must also be considered: Could other causes (personal, comorbid, or nonoccupational) possibly account for the symptom, illness, or injury in question? Could the exposure have been mitigated by engineering controls, personal protective equipment, immunization, or other means? Is the health effect causing functional impairment or disability? WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT Although causation may be definitely concluded or excluded in many instances based on the patient's history, a more detailed exposure history is necessary to guide the assessment and meet regulatory requirements (in nonacute or nontraumatic situations). This is especially true in cases where the injury or disease is not readily apparent, but rather may be attributable to low-level chronic exposure rather than an acute, readily identifiable event. In such situations, patients should be queried to provide information about workplace physical, chemical, or other exposures. For musculoskeletal disorders, this particularly includes a detailed description of the exertional demands of the job and, routinely, detailed time study, randomized work sampling, and quantification of the exertional demands of the job. The clinician might inquire about the total force used, local concentration of force (a forcefully applied grasp on a sharp tool handle edge), the frequency of specific motions or tasks, awkward postures, psychological and managerial issues, job satisfaction, and other factors, such as cold temperatures, the presence of vibration, and other factors that might increase the exertional demands of the job. For respiratory and toxicological exposures, questions should be focused on temporality of symptoms, along with the frequency, intensity, duration, and temporal patterns of exposure. Information obtained directly from the patient should be augmented by quantitative information from the worksite. Descriptions of events from coworkers and supervisors may prove useful in corroborating or refuting a patient's recall and history. Summaries of health effects from Safety Data Sheets (SDAs) may prove helpful in guiding the clinical inquiry and subsequent literature searches. Measuring exposures to chemical, physical, or biological exposures is often necessary to definitively address causation. Although qualitative measurements to determine whether or not a chemical, physical, or biological hazard is present are a common first step, quantitative measurements over time are often required to determine the frequency, intensity, duration, and temporal patterns of exposure. The appropriate measure(s) for chemical, physical, and biologic agents (eg, daily time-weighted averages cf. peak exposures) are required and guided by relevant epidemiological data or prescribed by federal or state regulations or generally accepted national and international standards (eg, ANSI, ISO, WHO). If possible, measurements should be concurrent with the time course of the problem, rather than using current measurements to impute previous exposure. If current measurements must be used, some assurance that conditions have not materially changed is needed in order to have some degree of confidence that the relationship is plausible. A worksite visit by the physician may be helpful. Depending on the issue, measurements by an appropriately trained ergonomist, industrial hygienist, occupational medicine physician, physical or occupational therapist may be needed to quantify exposure(s). Personal monitoring data are generally the most useful data to prove and quantify exposure (Table 2). If personal monitoring data or data of a surrogate are unavailable, area monitoring data are the next best option. Ideally, data should be acquired at a time or times when measured exposures would be expected to most closely replicate actual worksite conditions. Any further information that is available for exposure assessment, such as job records (job positions and times held in relationship to timing of disease development), video of job tasks, and monitoring data (work sampling, personal dosimetry, air monitoring, etc.), can be reviewed. A definitive assessment would require objective, quantified evidence of exposure to proven causative factors at levels known to produce the specific adverse health effects in question.TABLE 2: Hierarchy of Exposure DataRECORD REVIEW Definitive causal analysis often requires considerably more information than is available at the time that provisional assessments are made. A detailed and thorough medical history must be obtained, and relevant pre-existing symptoms, injuries, diseases, and disorders should be documented and critically analyzed. The source of information for the history may be the patient, concurrent medical records from other physicians, prior medical records, preplacement testing, or periodic medical surveillance data. Hospital and pharmacy records are usually quite informative. For histories of injuries, the most proximate records are given greater weight than later records with subsequent recall. LITERATURE REVIEW In many cases, a critical review of the epidemiologic and/or toxicological literature may be required to clarify the existing evidence linking exposure to health effects. Epidemiologic surveys may be needed to clarify the prevalence of complaints or health effects. A careful review of the published scientific literature may reveal a pattern of association between the apparent exposures and the patient's health effect. In most instances, epidemiologic studies should be based on workers in similar jobs or industries. Study populations may be compared to the circumstances of the patient in question including exposure dose, with higher quality studies utilizing individualized exposure measures (Table 2). In reviewing the scientific literature, the following questions apply: Are case definitions consistent among studies? Can a change in symptom or disease be predicted by a change in intensity, duration, body burden, or dose of the chemical, physical, psychological, or biologic factor? What is the quality of the available literature? Are the studies descriptive or observational? What is the quality of the study design (eg, randomized clinical trial, prospective cohort study, retrospective cohort study, or cross-sectional study. Greater credence generally accorded to prospective cohort studies for epidemiological questions (see Fig. 1). Were various potential sources of information bias (recall bias, reporting bias, healthy worker effects (attrition rates), volunteer bias, selection bias, or similar sources) recognized and accounted for? Were potentially confounding variables recognized and accounted for? What is the specific quantification of the exposure–effect relationship? Is there a statistical significance?

Methods: Information on cancer cases, drawn from six Italian population-based cancer registries (CRs of Friuli Venezia Giulia Region, Genoa Town and Genoa Province, Macerata Town, Umbria Region, Varese Town, Veneto Region), and on a random sample of population controls selected in each CRs area were linked with data on subjects employed in private enterprises that have been available in electronic form since 1974 at the National Institute for Social Security (INPS). In this way, both for cases and controls, the occupational histories of past employment were collected. A population-based case-control study covering the period 1990-1998 was carried out with the aim of estimating occupational cancer risk in the private sector by site and economic category in each area. Since one of the major drawbacks of this approach is the difficulty in distinguishing true occupational hazards from incidental findings derived from multiple comparisons, an extensive research of occupational literature was carried out, independently of the study results, to compare our results with existing knowledge on occupational risks. Results: Pooled analysis of the most recent incidence data based on 36,379 cases and 29,572 controls was performed; 34 ""statistically significant"" associations were found for 11 economic categories. Using our literature review, 10 associations were supported by more than 5 published papers, 14 by a number of papers between 1 and 5, and 10 associations had not been previously reported.

282,1635,Hans Well,1987,CHEST Journal,10.1378/chest.91.6.802,Diagnosis of Asbestos-related Disease,802-803,91,6,"Reasonable and effective public policy regarding the asbestos-related diseases should be based on sound scientific and medical knowledge. The categories of these policy issues are: 1) estimation of risks, which may not be measurable at current levels of exposure but which could lead to disease if exposures are not sufficiently controlled, and 2) adequate and equitable compensation of workers who have been injured by past exposures to asbestos in the workplace. The first requires a data base derived from epidemiologic studies of populations exposed to asbestos for whom valid quantitative health and exposure information is available. Resulting exposure-response relationships can lead to the setting of protective occupational standards and the appropriate allocation of resources to maximize health benefit when competing risks are presented to policy-makers for amelioration. The second issue can only be sensibly addressed when, as in other areas of medicine, diagnosis is based on generally accepted criteria which are supported by the known pathophysiology of the disease. With the asbestos-induced illnesses, there is no absolute specificity, as it relates to causation, only degrees of nonspecificity. Mesothelial tumors in asbestos-exposed individuals are very likely to be caused by this exposure, in contrast to lung cancer which, even in exposed persons, is more likely the result of smoking. A similar range in the degree of causal specificity is found in the nonmalignant conditions known to result from asbestos exposure. A joint committee of the ACCP/ATS, chaired by Dr. Raymond H. L. Murphy, was charged with the responsibility of providing a consensus view on diagnostic issues in the group of nonmalignant diseases for which compensation is being sought by thousands of former workers who allege injury due to their asbestos exposure. The resulting statement has recently been published.1Statement of the American Thoracic SocietyThe diagnosis of nonmalignant diseases related to asbestos.Am Rev Respir Dis. 1986; 134: 363-368PubMed Google Scholar Because there is often alarming abuse of sound medical principles and distortion of scientific knowledge, frequently perceived or justified as being beneficial to claimants, several points covered in this report will be highlighted. The comments are mine and do not necessarily reflect the views of the committee. Asbestosis is a term which indicates diffuse lung fibrosis due to asbestos exposure. Its use is not correct in reference to pleural abnormalities. The diagnosis of asbestosis is most often established by one or more clinical or laboratory findings, in conjunction with a history of nontrivial exposure. In fact, this diagnosis will almost always depend primarily on a radiographic appearance compatible with diffuse interstitial infiltrations, in addition to any other abnormalities which may be present on the chest radiograph. While it is rarely necessary, or possible, to examine lung tissue in order to make a diagnosis of asbestosis, when a pathologic diagnosis is made it must be based on the demonstration of both asbestos bodies and fibrosis. Neither alone is sufficient. As in the pathologic diagnosis of other diffuse lung diseases, attention must be paid to adequate size and representativeness of the tissue sample. As indicated, the chest x-ray film plays a central role in the diagnosis of asbestosis. Improved radiographic technique and quality assurance make possible the sensitive detection, by experienced readers, of asbestosis of even minimal extent. The international classification for the pneumoconioses2International Labour OfficeGuidelines for the use of ILO international classification of radiographs of pneumoconioises, rev ed 1980.Occupational Safety and Health series No 22. International Labour Office, Geneva1980Google Scholar includes grading of the irregular and linear opacities characteristic of asbestosis. The classification was designed to be used for epidemiologic research and has been helpful in encouraging the training of qualified readers. Indeed, many physicians have taken tests, using standard films, in order to become “certified readers,” often for the purpose of establishing credibility when making a radiographic diagnosis of asbestosis (or other pneumoconiosis) in the litigation/compensation arena. There have been undesirable consequences of the use of the ILO Classification for this purpose. The classification is intended to be descriptive, albeit quantitative. The 12 categories of profusion of small opacities cover the range from normal to marked. It is at the lower categories (0/1 to 1/1) that the greatest degree of interobserver variability (disagreement) occurs. No one category will constitute the lower limit of abnormalities which is “diagnostic” of asbestosis for all qualified readers. For one reader this level will more or less be equivalent to an ILO reading of 1/1 for irregular small opacities, for another, 1/0. In the past, categories as high as 2/2 have been suggested. It is unfortunate that some readers have interpreted the ACCP/ATS statement to suggest that a reading of at least 1/1 for small opacities is required to support a diagnosis of asbestosis. It is more appropriate to consider that level as illustrative of a film compatible with asbestosis. So might also a category 1/0 film; it depends on the reader. Should there be any who think that “mandating” a category sufficient to make a diagnosis of asbestosis will lead to standardization, it should be remembered that any such category can be inappropriately chosen by a given reader, just as now interstitial fibrosis is often “read” on a negative film. Choosing a “diagnostic” category will not, regrettably, suffice to confer credibility on the system. A physiologic pattern of reduced lung volumes and disturbed gas transfer or the finding of inspiratory crackles are supportive of the diagnosis but are too nonspecific to be helpful in isolation. Clubbing (also nonspecific) is too rare to be useful; dyspnea is almost always present in claimants and can therefore not be a discriminating feature. The fibrotic process of asbestosis begins in peribronchiolar areas of the lung. Peripheral airways dysfunction has been demonstrated in population studies and the pathologic analog described. However, clinical and epidemiologic evidence is now more than sufficient to firmly conclude that clinically significant chronic airways obstruction is not an expected consequence of asbestos exposure in the absence of far more important causal factors, most notably, smoking. Pleural thickening, focal (plaques) or diffuse, results from asbestos exposure. Plaques do not affect lung function, and diffuse pleural thickening reduces lung volumes only when it is very extensive. It is still not clear if the presence of benign pleural abnormalities constitutes a risk factor (beyond exposure) for the development of asbestos-related tumors. Whether pleural effects are compensable is, of course, a societal decision. It should, however, be based on accurate information. Improving the standard of diagnosis in the asbestos-related diseases is important not only because limited public and private resources should go to those with true occupationally-induced injury. As physicians, we have a responsibility to be truthful and humane in our dealings with patients, including those being evaluated for an occupational disease. Both over- and underdiagnosis can be detrimental. Overdiagnosis will evoke needless fear and perceived incapacity in normal individuals—too great a price for possible (usually minimal) economic gain. Underdiagnosis can delay appropriate compensation, increasing the burden of disease on an ill worker and his family. Either premature or delayed diagnosis can, depending on state law, result in loss of any chance for compensation. Diagnostic standards are needed and achievable, even in occupational disease. Credentialing in the specialties of medicine depends on evaluating candidates on their cognitive knowledge regarding, among other things, diagnostic criteria. Some in the legal community are determined to resist medical standards for diagnosing these diseases, citing the undermining of the tort system (every claimant should have his day in court). They frequently have allies among their medical consultants and witnesses. The large number of claims and lawsuits for asbestosis, and other asbestos-related diseases, makes the need for credible diagnosis even more urgent.",0012-3692 1931-3543,-1,openalex,1635,,,,16

Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is a highly sensitive technique for detecting noninvasive small lung tumors in high-risk populations. We here analyze the current status of lung cancer screening (LCS) from a European point of view. With economic burden of health care in most European countries resting on the state, it is important to reduce costs of screening and improve its effectiveness. Current cost-effectiveness analyses on LCS have indicated a favorable economic profile. The most recently published analysis reported an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €3,297 per 1 life-year gained adjusted for the quality of life (QALY) and €2,944 per life-year gained, demonstrating a 90% probability of ICER being below €15,000 and a 98.1% probability of being below €25,000. Different risk models have been used to identify the target population; among these, the PLCOM2012 in particular allows for the selection of the population to be screened with high sensitivity. Risk models should also be employed to define screening intervals, which can reduce the general number of LDCT scans after the baseline round. Future perspectives of screening in a European scenario are related to the will of the policy makers to implement policy on a large scale and to improve the effectiveness of a broad screening of smoking-related disease, including cardiovascular prevention, by measuring coronary calcium score on LDCT. The employment of artificial intelligence (AI) in imaging interpretation, the use of liquid biopsies for the characterization of CT-detected undetermined nodules, and less invasive, personalized surgical treatments, will improve the effectiveness of LCS.",2218-6751 2226-4477,-1,openalex,1609,,,,17

We carried out a dose-response meta-analysis to investigate and quantify the potential dose-response association between residential and occupational exposure to radon and the risk of LC. All cohort and case-control studies published in English and Chinese on Embase, PubMed, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) digital databases through November 2013 were identified systematically. We extracted effect measures (relative risk, odds ratio, standardized mortality ratio, standardized incidence ratio, or standardized rate ratio) from individual studies to generate pooled results using meta-analysis approaches. We derived meta-analytic estimates using random-effects models taking into account the correlation between estimates. Restricted cubic splines and generalized least-squares regression methods were used to model a potential curvilinear relationship and to carry out a dose-response meta-analysis. Stratified analysis, sensitivity analysis, and assessment of bias were performed in our meta-analysis. Sixty publications fulfilling the inclusion criteria for this meta-analysis were finally included. Occupational RE was associated with LC [risk ratio 1.86, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.67-2.09; I²=92.2%; 27 prospective studies], for pooled risk estimate of the: standardized mortality ratio [2.00 (95% CI=1.82-2.32)]; standardized incidence ratio [1.45 (95% CI=1.20-1.74)]; relative risk [2.10 (95% CI=1.64-2.69)]. In a subgroup analysis of uranium miners and residents exposed to occupational uranium, the summary risk was 2.23 (95% CI=1.86-2.68) and 1.23 (95% CI=1.05-1.44). The overall meta-analysis showed evidence of a nonlinear association between RE and the risk of LC (P(nonlinearity)<0.014); in addition, the point value of residential radon also improved the results quantitatively, where odds ratios were 1.11 (95% CI=1.07-1.15) and 1.21 (95% CI=1.14-1.29) when the radon concentration was at the point of 100 and 200 Bq/m³ compared with the lowest.

The assessment of risk of bias within individual studies and across studies indicated risk that was unlikely to alter these results markedly.

We show that, under this definition, even the average probability of causation among exposed cases is not identifiable from epidemiologic data. This is because the probability of causation depends both on the unknown mechanisms by which exposure affects disease risk and competing risks, and on the unknown degree of heterogeneity in the background disease risk of the exposed population. We derive the maximum and minimum values for the probability of causation consistent with the observable population quantities. We also derive the relationship of the 'assigned share' (excess incidence rate as a proportion of total incidence rate) to the probability of causation.",0006-341X,-1,embase,1262,,,,21

II: Practical attempts",363-374,64,6,"Aim of the study: To determine the respective role of each of multiple exposures in the occurrence of a disease such as bronchial cancer. Are the probability of causation and apportionment useful when occupational exposure is associated to non-professional exposure? Method: From uses in several countries for various exposures, the method of probability is applied to bronchial cancer and asbestos exposure taking into account smoking habits. For multiple exposures, the apportionment of the risks had to be calculated. Results: The apportionment is necessary to analyse the respective risks related to multiple exposures taking into account the dose-response relationships and the interactions. Smoking plays a major role in the occurrence of lung cancer. Thus the risks induced by smoking cannot be neglected nor be an automatic reason to exclude an occupational origin. The probability of causation for multiple exposure and apportionment for multiple exposures are based on scientific knowledge and can be used to establish guidelines of consistent criteria for recognition of occupational disease. In France, stepwise decision tree and apportionment might be useful for the Comités régionaux de reconnaissance des maladies professionnelles. However, these statistical methods arise theoretical, practical, ethical problems. They may be used in only few cases because of the uncertainties of the dose-response relationships, of the interactions between substances and of the quantifications of individual exposures.",1250-3274,manual_review,embase,1185,,,,22

Given the increase in the number of workers exposed to radiation, as well as the increase in concern regarding occupational cancer, the number of radiation-related occupational cancer claims is expected to increase. Unlike exposure assessment of other carcinogenic agents in the workplace, such as asbestos and benzene, radiation exposure is usually assessed on an individual basis with personal dosimeters, which makes it feasible to assess whether a worker's cancer occurrence is associated with their individual exposure. However, given the absence of a threshold dose for cancer initiation, it remains difficult to identify radiation exposure as the root cause of occupational cancer. Moreover, the association between cancer and radiation exposure in the workplace has not been clearly established due to a lack of scientific evidence. Therefore, criteria for the recognition of radiation-related occupational cancer should be carefully reviewed and updated with new scientific evidence and social consensus. The current criteria in Korea are valid in terms of eligible radiogenic cancer sites, adequate latent period, assessment of radiation exposure, and probability of causation. However, reducing uncertainty with respect to the determination of causation between exposure and cancer and developing more specific criteria that considers mixed exposure to radiation and other carcinogenic agents remains an important open question.",2052-4374,-1,embase,1059,,,,23

The 5 most common cancer sites are prostate, colorectum, breast, melanoma of skin and lung. The estimated proportion of cancers due to occupation was about 11% of incident cancers in males and 2% in females. This equates to about 5000 cancers a year. Using an estimate from the European Union (not consider the risk controls at workplace), approximately 1.5 million workers in Australia are potentially exposed to carcinogens at work. Diesel exhaust has recently been classified as 'carcinogenic to humans' by the International Agency for Research on Cancers, and has been associated with increased risk of death from lung cancer (sufficient evidence) and bladder cancer (limited evidence). Hazardous levels of diesel exhaust can be found in occupations in Australia ranging from mining to driving diesel-fuelled trucks, graders, cranes or forklifts. Because of difficulties in proving causation, and the long lag time between occupational exposure and cancer, occupational cancer related to diesel exhaust exposure can be difficult to identify and diagnose. In addition, there are multiple substances existing in workplaces which do or may cause different types of cancer. In this paper, diesel exhaust will be used as an example and the challenges in diagnosis of occupational cancers will be discussed.",1948-5956,-1,embase,1112,,,,25

Approximately 2% to 8% of all cancers are thought to be due to occupation. In addition, occupational and environmental cancers have their own characteristics, e.g., specific chemicals and cancers, multiple factors, multiple causation and interaction, or latency period. Concerning carcinogens, asbestos/silica/wood dust, soot/polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons [benzo(a) pyrene], heavy metals (arsenic, chromium, nickel), aromatic amines (4-aminobiphenyl, benzidine), organic solvents (benzene or vinyl chloride), radiation/radon, or indoor pollutants (formaldehyde, tobacco smoking) are mentioned with their specific cancers, e.g., lung, skin, and bladder cancers, mesothelioma or leukemia, and exposure routes, rubber or pigment manufacturing, textile, painting, insulation, mining, and so on. In addition, nanoparticles, electromagnetic waves, and climate changes are suspected as future carcinogenic sources. Moreover, the aspects of environmental and occupational cancers are quite different between developing and developed countries. The recent follow-up of occupational cancers in Nordic countries shows a good example for developed countries. On the other hand, newly industrializing countries face an increased burden of occupational and environmental cancers. Developing countries are particularly suffering from preventable cancers in mining, agriculture, or industries without proper implication of safety regulations. Therefore, industrialized countries are expected to educate and provide support for developing countries. In addition, citizens can encounter new environmental and occupational carcinogen nominators such as nanomaterials, electromagnetic wave, and climate exchanges. As their carcinogenicity or involvement in carcinogenesis is not clearly unknown, proper consideration for them should be taken into account. For these purposes, new technologies with a balance of environment and gene are required.

The population attributable fraction (PAF) answers this question. ""Attributable to"" is understood as ""due to"", which makes PAFs closely related to the concept of potential impact or potential benefits of reducing the exposure. The PAF is a tool at the border between science and decision making. PAFs are estimated based on strong assumptions and the calculations are data intensive, making them vulnerable to gaps in knowledge and data. Current misconceptions include summing up PAFs to 100% or subtracting a PAF for a factor from 100% to deduce what proportion is left to be explained or prevented by other factors. This error is related to unrecognised multicausality or shared causal responsibility in disease aetiology. Attributable cases only capture cases in excess and should be regarded as a lower bound for aetiological cases, which cannot be estimated based on epidemiological data alone (exposure-induced cases). The population level might not be relevant to discuss prevention priorities based on PAFs, for instance when exposures concentrate in a subgroup of the population, as for occupational lung carcinogens and other workplace hazards. Alternative approaches have been proposed based on absolute rather than relative metrics, such as estimating potential gains in life expectancy that can be expected from a specific policy (prevention) or years of life lost due to a specific exposure that already happened (compensation).",1810-6838,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1301, 1023, 1617",,,,28

A priori occupations for analysis were those whose members had received compensation for occupational cancer from the Ontario Workers' Compensation Board. Population attributable risks were computed using the relative risks observed in this study and employment data from the 1986 Census of Canada. Subjects were all men (N = 967) between the ages of 45 and 75 years resident in the cities of Hamilton and Sault Ste-Marie who died of lung cancer from 1979 to 1988. Controls (2,821) were matched on age, year of death, and city of residence. In agreement with other studies, an increased risk of lung cancer was observed for workers in the construction sector, for miners, and for truck drivers. It was estimated that only a small proportion of lung cancers attributable to occupation are compensated in Ontario. It is believed that many occupational cancers go uncompensated because of the failure to file claims, rather than because claims are rejected by Compensation Boards. Physicians are in a position to advise patients about the possibility of compensable disease and to act as advocates for them. By recognizing compensable illness, physicians have the opportunity to ease the financial burden of patients and their families.

Due to their heavy overall disease burdens and high healthcare spending, examining the fraction of respiratory diseases attributable to occupational factors is helpful in understanding the magnitude of under-estimation of occupational injuries and diseases. Methods Prevalence rates of various occupational exposures were assessed retrospectively with self-reported surveys or job-exposure matrices. Relative risks of theses exposures were drawn from international epidemiological literatures. The above two parameters were used to calculate population attributable risk percentages (PAR%), and with that the numbers of visiting and amounts of payment attributable to occupational factors were estimated based on the claim data of the National Health Insurance (NHI). The estimates were compared with the data of actual payment by the Workers' Compensation Insurance (WCI). Results We estimated that around 15 000 patients visited medical facilities for occupational respiratory diseases in 2015, costing a total of 10 million USD. In contrast, less than 200 cases were approved by WCI in the same year. A 100-fold gap between the estimated and actual payment was also noted. Estimation analyses further indicated that 9.6% of cases and 48.1% of healthcare costs were asbestos-related. Conclusion For occupational respiratory diseases with long latency periods and great causal complexity, the scope of under-estimation was substantial, and their medical expenses had been largely paid by NHI rather than WCI.

With medical advances and evolving issues of international and national importance, these competencies have been updated. Basic competencies set the minimum expectations for physicians. Although being competent in a subject may not mean that it is a current element of an individual physician’s practice, the physician must have the knowledge base and skill so that they could include it in their practice. Continued medical education is expected of all physicians, and directing their efforts to state-of-the-art OEM is crucial. The listing of competencies by ACOEM assists practicing physicians in their efforts to keep current and to serve as knowledgeable representatives of the specialty. For the purpose of this document, competency is defined as “possession of sufficient physical, intellectual, and behavioral qualifications (ie, knowledge, skills, abilities, and attitudes) to perform a task or serve in a role which adequately accomplishes a desired outcome.” In order for OEM physicians to have a solid identity for employers, government agencies, health care organizations, and other health practitioners, a short list of core competencies is essential. This document presents a list of 10 core competencies that identify the areas of medicine that are the basis of the OEM specialty. The core competencies identify broad definitions of content that must be further clarified. A listing of the skills that would be expected with each competency is crucial. Because of the diversity of OEM practitioners, there are a host of skills that define the specialty. This approach of identifying core competencies accompanied by extensive clarification will provide assistance to training programs as well as to those organizations and businesses that will be starting or expanding occupational and environmental services. The process used to arrive at the competencies was straightforward. The committee that developed this document represents diverse practices including academics, corporate, private practice, government, and residency directors. The OEM competencies in use by other organizations and countries were evaluated, as well as other current publications as outlined in the reference materials. Input was sought by experts in specific content area. A physician specializing in OEM is expected to be competent in all 10 core competencies, whereas a non-OEM physician may have a few of the listed skills. In addition to the specific OEM competencies, there are important skills that those practicing OEM may obtain but that are not an aspect of the basic foundation of OEM. Competencies that are expected of all physicians are also separated out from the OEM specific competencies. The 10 core competencies are listed and defined on the next few pages. The ACOEM 10 Core Competencies Clinical OEM OEM-related law and regulations Environmental health Work fitness and disability integration Toxicology Hazard recognition, evaluation, and control Disaster preparedness and emergency management Health and productivity Public health, surveillance, and disease prevention OEM-related management and administration Core Competencies Defined Clinical OEM.

Apply clinical practice guidelines in one’s practice of medicine. Diagnose and manage injuries associated with physical hazards including heat (eg, heat stress, heat stroke, heat syncope, heat exhaustion, and heat cramps), cold (eg, hypothermia, frostbite, chilblains, and immersion foot), radiation, lasers, and vibration. Clinical—Cardiology. Individuals with underlying cardiac risk factors and disease may encounter special concerns in safety-sensitive jobs, while working around certain chemical agents, and in performing exertional labor. OEM physicians assist patients, employers, primary care physicians and cardiologists in the secondary and tertiary prevention of cardiac disease, as well as the accommodation of workers with cardiac concerns. The perspective of the OEM physician is particularly useful in placing workers in special assignments such as emergency response, hazardous waste, forklift, and respirator use. Recognize, evaluate, and manage the cardiac effects of chemical asphyxiants such as carbon monoxide, methylene chloride, and cyanide. Evaluate a person’s ability to perform exertional work after a major cardiac event such as a myocardial infarction or coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Clinical—Dermatology. Occupational dermatoses are one of the leading causes of occupational disease in the United States. Dermatoses also occur as a result of exposure to hazardous compounds in the home environment. OEM physicians can provide early recognition, diagnosis, and management of these disorders and make necessary recommendations to minimize their occurrence both in the workplace and at home. Differentiate occupational skin disorders by history, examination, and diagnostic evaluation. Diagnose and determine the cause of allergic contact dermatitis (including urticaria), particularly those caused by common antigens such as latex, epoxy monomer, and nickel.

Identify, manage, and prevent bloodborne, airborne, waterborne, foodborne, and fomiteborne pathogen exposure and associated illnesses. Identify, manage, and prevent diseases of travelers. Identify, manage, and prevent infestations and zoonotic conditions. Clinical—Musculoskeletal. Musculoskeletal injuries comprise a majority of the acute occupational injuries seen by the OEM physician and cause major productivity, financial, and human losses for employees and employers alike. Thorough understanding of the anatomy, physiology, and pathology of the musculoskeletal system, as well as appropriate diagnostic and management skills, are essential. OEM physicians are able to correlate clinical conditions with functional capacity in relation to activities of daily living and work. Applying the principles of epidemiology and ergonomics enables the OEM physician to facilitate the development of programs to prevent these conditions. Perform focused and comprehensive musculoskeletal evaluations, including the history, physical examination, laboratory studies, and the investigation of occupational risk factors. Select appropriate diagnostic tests in the evaluation of patients with musculoskeletal conditions using evidence-based guidelines. Identify, manage, and prevent acute and chronic musculoskeletal disorders and their associated disabilities, and determine when such conditions are work-related. Diagnose, manage, and prevent spine disorders, including low back pain. Diagnose, manage, and prevent cumulative trauma disorders, with attention to specificity of diagnosis and etiology, and both occupational and nonoccupational risk factors. Diagnose, manage, and prevent joint and extremity injuries and disorders. Prescribe ergonomic interventions and appropriate rehabilitation services for an injured worker. Identify delayed recovery and manage chronic musculoskeletal pain syndromes. Clinical—Neurology. Occupational and environmental exposures can cause acute and chronic effects on the central and peripheral nervous systems. The OEM physician has the skills and knowledge to evaluate, diagnose, and prevent exposure-related neurologic conditions and to facilitate the placement of workers with neurologic disorders. Perform focused neurological and mental status examinations in the evaluation of occupational or environmental injuries or illnesses. When indicated, select and utilize the results of neurological and mental status examination procedures or consultations in the evaluation of occupational or environmental injuries or illnesses. Such studies may include magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, central nervous system electrodiagnostic studies (eg, electroencephalogram, evoked potentials), peripheral nerve electrophysiologic studies (eg, nerve-conduction studies; electromyography), or neuropsychological batteries. Clinical—Ophthalmology. The OEM physician has the clinical and administrative knowledge and skills to 1) evaluate and treat occupational eye injuries; 2) develop and implement vision screening and protection programs; and 3) use information from the eye examination, such as visual acuity tests, to assist in the proper placement of workers. Identify the need for specialized ophthalmologic services and surveillance (eg, lasers, ethambutol use). Recognize and treat occupational eye diseases and injuries and refer to an ophthalmologist when appropriate. Diagnose and manage infectious and irritative conjunctivitis. Diagnose and treat ultraviolet photokeratitis. Identify and remove superficial foreign bodies from the eye, with follow-up care as indicated.

National data sets collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, the Health Care Financing Administration, and the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality were aggregated and analyzed. The cost assessment began with estimates of national health expenditures. These included categories for hospital care, professional services, nursing homes, and medical products, including drugs, administration, public health activities, research and construction. The total disease burden was assessed from estimates of hospital days and number of outpatient visits. The occupational disease burden was assessed by multiplying the total disease burden by a given percentage of the proportionate attributable risk for the disease in question. The occupational burden was then combined with costs for each disease. Adjustments were made for unique inpatient and outpatient costs. In the preferred model, the 14 diseases generated USD 14.5 billion in medical costs in 1999. Roughly USD 10.7 billion was attributed to men and USD 3.8 billion to women. The diseases generating the most costs were as follows: circulatory diseases in the age group 24-64 years (USD 4.7 billion), cancer (USD 4.3 billion), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (USD 2.2 billion), and asthma (USD 1.5 billion). A sensitivity analysis generated alternative estimates. An upper age limit of 74 years increased the circulatory disease estimate by USD 3.7 billion. The range of the sensitivity analysis was USD 9.6-19.7 billion. This study significantly improves over the methodology of previous literature. Our methods were transparent.

The lifetime risk for urinary bladder cancer in the United States ranges from 0.5%-3%, depending on gender and ethnic group, with Caucasian males having the highest rate. Occupational exposures account for one-quarter of this risk in Caucasian males, and chemicals are central to creating this workplace hazard. Past research indicates that the aryl amines, benzidine, 2-naphthalene, and aniline dyes, are the main chemicals associated with bladder carcinogenesis. Aim. Because long-term, high-level occupational exposure to strong-inorganic-acid mists containing sulphuric acid is an established carcinogen, the relationship between occupational acid exposure and bladder cancer was tested as part of an extensive occupational cancer case-control study of 513 male hospitalized patients in the Campania Region of Italy. Patients and methods. The full dataset included exposure information on up to 20 major groups of occupational chemicals with the target cancers of lung (n = 111), laryngeal (n = 35), naso/nasal/pharyngeal (n = 22), oral cavity (n = 23) and bladder (n = 75). For this study, cases (n = 75) were defined as people with bladder cancer, while controls (n = 270) were other unmatched patients with oral cavity cancers (but none of the other three target cancers) or patients with any other reason for hospitalization. Unconditional logistic regression was used to fit the acid-bladder cancer model controlling the effects of tobacco and age. Other confounders, such as alcohol and coffee consumption (the only dietary variable in our dataset) are discussed and considered, but neither was significant. Results. The results demonstrate an adjusted statistically significant association between occupational acid exposure and bladder cancer (OR = 4.09; p = 0.028). Discussion. The implications of this new finding in humans are discussed, both in the context of existing evidence, and in light of the 1992-IARC designation based on research to that time demonstrating the role of acid mixtures in the causation of upper respiratory tract cancers.

149,1683,Rodney Ehrlich,2015,American Journal of Industrial Medicine,10.1002/ajim.22528,History and medicine—The case of silicosis,1-2,58,S1,"In 1995 the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and World Health Organisation launched a campaign to eliminate silicosis, based on the notion that the knowledge and means required for its elimination were within our reach [Fedotov and Eijkemans, 2007]. Despite this vision, silicosis is still very much with us, whether in the epidemic form identified in the South African mining industry [Rees et al., 2009], in less visible epidemic form in a multitude of small operations in India [Jindal, 2013] or in outbreaks in novel settings [Kramer et al., 2012; Akgun et al., 2015]. At the political level, current efforts in the US to reduce the risk of silicosis and other silica related diseases have been stalled by representatives of corporate interests [Rosner, 2014]. The persistence of this ancient hazard and the complex relationship between silica and silicosis and other diseases associated with them, is reflected in ongoing research interest in the subject. A perusal of published English literature reveals an increased number of mechanistic studies exploring inflammatory pathways and genetic markers, continuing interest in complications such as lung cancer and autoimmune disease, and a plethora of silicosis case studies and industry surveys particularly from developing countries. A parallel history literature illuminates silica and silicosis discourse, regulation and compensation and the social forces shaping these processes [for example, Rosner and Markowitz, 2005; McCulloch, 2012]. This literature makes clear that how a society defines and compensates silicosis, and occupational disease more generally, is as much socially determined as biomedically defined. This conjunction of social and scientific processes makes silicosis a rich seam for interdisciplinary research. To this end, researchers associated with the Centre l'Etudes Européennes at Sciences Po, have chosen to shine a light on the international conference held in Johannesburg in 1930. Convened in a city barely 45 years old, the conference was to be highly influential in securing international expert agreement on the nosology and etiology of silicosis, and paved the way for inclusion of silicosis in an ILO convention on compensation for occupational diseases four years later. The significance of the location lay in the fact that South Africa, a new political entity in the early stages of a mining led industrialization, had concentrated both a lethal epidemic of silicosis and related tuberculosis [Katz, 1994], and pioneering expertise in medicine, radiology, pathology and dust measurement. It was thus on the Witwatersrand, the gold-bearing ridge of which Johannesburg was the center, that the International Labour Office and the Transvaal Chamber of Mines, the industry association, convened this international gathering on 13–27 August, 1930. The papers that make up this special issue of the AJIM are drawn from presentations at a 2013 Colloquium, held at Sciences Po, in partnership with Columbia University, entitled From silicosis to silica hazards: an experiment in medicine, history and the social sciences, and part of a European Research Council funded project bringing together expertise in history, sociology, pathology, occupational medicine and mineralogy [http://www.sciencespo.fr/silicosis/fr]. A reading of the papers revised for this special issue suggests at least three levels of exploration. The first can be characterized as institutional history—the illumination of conflicting aims and agendas of the participants and organizing entities of the 1930 conference, the interests that were served by the resolutions that emerged, and the subsequent impact of these resolutions in South Africa and internationally. The second concerns the history of medical or scientific ideas—in this case, the lasting influence of decisions made at the conference on biomedical conceptualization of silica and silicosis, specifically, the authors argue, a narrowing influence which remains with us today. The third level is perhaps the most ambitious. This involves adopting, as it were, a counterfactual position to the one that emerged from the conference, and refocusing, through epidemiological and laboratory investigation using modern techniques, on silica as an agent with etiological effects across a wider spectrum of pulmonary and systemic disease than the one ""truncated"" in 1930. The prevention of silicosis requires environmental controls. However, there is much that is still unappreciated about silicosis, such its extensive pre-radiological phase [Hnizdo et al., 1993], and much that is poorly understood about silica, such as the mechanisms of its tuberculogenic, carcinogenic and autoimmune effects. Intensified attention to these questions may also bring wider rewards, for example, in the understanding of the interaction between infectious and non-infectious agents in disease causation, the nature of immune disturbance by mineral agents and the relationship between fibrosis and carcinogenesis. Even more general is the untapped potential of an approach that entrains history and medicine in a joint effort to re-examine the ways in which ideas about disease are formed. By revealing the origins of established habits of thought and practice, such joint effort may open new paths, or re-open old paths, of investigation into a number of disease entities, occupational or otherwise.

It identifies occupational and non-occupational factors which contribute to occupational mortality and morbidity. Eight categories of mortality and morbidity are identified as priorities for discussion, based on UK data. These are cardiovascular disease; lung cancer; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; occupational deafness; dermatitis; vibration white finger; tenosynovitis; and suicide. Non-occupational factors associated with these include age, sex, race, smoking, social class, alcohol consumption, diet, exposures in leisure time, exercise, atopy, heredity, personal hygiene, personality type, stress, past or predisposing illness or injury, weather/climate and air pollution. Smoking is identified as the most widely studied non-occupational factor in occupational disease. Smoking interacts with some occupational exposures to produce more disease than the sum of both agents separately. Smoking and asbestos interact multiplicatively in lung cancer causation. The ability to quantify interactions between occupational and non-occupational factors in disease etiology is important in assessing priorities for preventive action. Despite this, only the interactions of smoking have begun to be defined. The many other non-occupational factors mentioned above have each been studied individually but their interactions with occupational factors have not been assessed.

This chapter focuses on examining occupational cancers in the parenchyma of the lungs, and starts with a historical review on the identification of lung carcinogens in various occupational groups. Occupational lung cancer linked to radon was first described in 1879. Various occupational exposures were subsequently found to increase the risk of lung cancer. Of the 107 agents classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as Group 1 (confirmed human) carcinogens, 26 are regarded as carcinogens for lung cancers, and all except two mainly involve occupational exposures. Exposure to occupational carcinogens is an important determinant of lung cancer death and disability globally. Estimates on the contribution of occupational cancers to the population disease burden of lung cancer (population attributable fractions) ranged from 0.6 to 40%, depending on the population or geographical location, which might be explained by the different mix of industries and exposures. When examining the possible etiologic associations between occupational exposures and lung cancer, the effect of smoking should be carefully examined, as smoking is the most important cause for lung cancer in most countries, and exposures to occupational lung carcinogens not infrequently coexist with smoking. Smoking can act as a confounder or can modify the effects of occupational lung carcinogens. Lung cancers are irreversible and self-propagating, usually with poor prognosis, and hence should best be prevented. For occupational cancer, primary prevention is most relevant and has been found to be very successful in the past. Removing the agent, through elimination or substitution of known carcinogens, is most effective. Exposure can also be reduced through engineering and administrative means by modification of the plant, the working environment or the work process.",,abstract_added,openalex,1615,,,,41

However, in 2018 OSHRI recognized gastric and rectal cancers as work-related disease in asbestos-exposed workers. We present 2 such cases along supportive evidence of causation. Case presentation: Patient A: A 57-year-old man had worked for about 40 years since 1978 as an oxygen cutter at workplaces that dismantle ships, buildings, boilers, and thermal power plants. In November 2016, endoscopy and biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of advanced gastric cancer, for which he underwent subtotal gastrectomy and chemotherapy; however, he later died of the cancer. Patient B: A 71-year-old man had worked in shipbuilding and repair workplaces for approximately 49 years, being employed in pipe laying, asbestos insulation installation, grinding, and other ship repair work. In 2003, he was diagnosed of rectal cancer by abdominal computed tomography. He accordingly underwent surgical removal of the cancer. Based on the occupational history of the 2 patients and our review of the relevant literature addressing the occupational environment, we concluded that both patients had continuous exposure to high levels of asbestos while performing their jobs for 40 and 49 years, respectively. Conclusion: Both patients had a history of smoking and drinking (non-occupational personal risk factors). However, the possibility of an increased risk of gastric and rectal cancers from asbestos exposure cannot be excluded. Therefore, we considered that occupational exposure to asbestos had contributed to the cancer diagnosis in these cases. Workers exposed to asbestos should be made aware of the possibility of gastric or rectal cancer, and should undergo monitoring and medical examinations.

Glenhaven Funeral Services Ltd [2002] UKHL 22, [2003] 1 AC 32) in a lung cancer case.This means that damages are awarded against each employer in proportion to the increase in risk for which each was responsible.This decision offers a typical example of alternative causation, where multiple independent defendants may have caused the plaintiff's harm, but less than all (or just one defendant) actually caused it. 1Alternative causation cases are exceptional in Belgian law, the decision therefore offers an invitation to discuss the issue.First, from a Belgian perspective, it is remarkable that the Court of Appeal does not apply the conditio sine qua non test, but falls back on another test (i.e. the Fairchild exception) which limits the liability of the employers to the extent of the exposure they generated.Second, civil liability actions for injuries caused by asbestos exposure are very rare in Belgium, because of the elaborate system of compensation funds.In the following commentary, I will pay attention to these two main differences, setting forth the current Belgian state of the art.The first section focuses on the civil liability approach of alternative causation in general and asbestos cases in particular.The second section examines two compensation funds which are playing a prominent role in this field: the Fund for occupational diseases and the Asbestos fund.",0928-9801 1875-8371,title_duplicate,openalex,"1665, 1749",,,,43

The same study also reported that the CYP2E1 c1c2/c2c2 genotype was significantly associated with liver damage (OR 3.3).How should occupational health and safety professionals use these data? A further decrease in the occupational health standard for vinyl chloride in China should be the immediate reply. How about the data on polymorphic CYP2E1?We are on the threshold of a new revolution in understanding the interaction of genes with the environment. The relative roles of heritable and environmental causes in occupational hazards are an important scientific issue, with many practical consequences. Traditional geneticists have emphasised genes, while epidemiologists have argued for the environment. The literature on disease causation is full of overstatements, but recent data from twin and family studies offer more scientifically‐based estimates of the apportionment of disease causation. With the emergence of the versatile tool of single nucleotide polymorphisms, studies on “gene‐environment interactions” have become popular. The studies have produced a number of reports with no or only modest impacts of gene‐environment interaction on environmentally‐induced disease.2 Furthermore, there are many embedded controversial issues. Mass reporting of results has occurred, with little consideration of the functionality of single nucleotide polymorphisms or the tissue of expression of the relevant genes in subgroups with little biological rationale. It is ironic that the traditional roles of epidemiologists and geneticists appear to have been reversed: the proponents of gene‐environment interactions seem to be stressing the overwhelming importance of genetic factors acting in concert with environmental factors, while geneticists are raising concern.3The setting of permissible occupational exposure limits is a practical example of the importance of understanding the relative contributions of the environment and genes. The role of polymorphic genes in occupational disease risks has been the subject of extensive research for several decades. Some polymorphic genes do not present a risk in the absence of a given exposure but do so when the exposure occurs.As Schulte points out in his editorial, “it remains unclear to what extent identifying susceptibles can be applied in occupational safety and health”.4 Unlike most occupational exposures, which can be reduced or eliminated if proven to cause harm, inherited gene variants cannot be changed and can be passed on to subsequent generations. Given the number of metabolising enzymes and the wide variation in their expression, it would be too simplistic to propose that one gene at a time be examined in relation to disease risk. Therefore, methods and techniques have been developed for examining whole pathways, containing tens to hundreds of genes, and their expression patterns in relation to disease risk. In a shifting strategy, researchers are using whole‐genome scanning to search for disease genes. This technique casts a wide net over the genome, allowing researchers to evaluate thousands of genes simultaneously without prior assumptions about the underlying mechanisms. Although this whole‐genome scanning might reveal new disease pathways, it has key limitations, such as the exclusion of the important post‐translational epigenetic phenomena. Until these powerful new techniques have shown their full potential, it will be difficult to use genetic characteristics or risks in subgroups when setting exposure limits.Successful disease prevention programmes at the worksite should ideally be based on an understanding of the natural history of the disease or injury. Many of the factors in gene‐environment interactions are modifiable, and these would provide a good starting point for primary prevention in the occupational setting. The number of genes that contribute to susceptibility to disease is likely to be large, and the effects of each gene on a disease will be weak. For example, if a dozen or more genes contribute to myocardial infarct or to lung cancer, attempts to identify susceptible occupational subgroups for intervention would be too complex to be of practical value. Thus, in the case of these and many other chronic diseases, it is likely that more people would benefit from changes in their work conditions or other modifiable factors than from knowledge about their genes. For complex diseases such as cancer, for which there are a number of underlying critical genes, the likelihood that gene‐environment studies will provide answers with practical applicability is decreasing.5If scientists conduct a comprehensive search for the genetic basis of every health outcome and ignore occupational exposures and other work‐related factors and attributable risks, we are likely to miss opportunities to prevent disease and injury. Over‐optimistic expectations about the ability of genomics to address chronic diseases (stemming partly from a lack of understanding of the complexity of disease causation and partly from a tendency by some scientists to overemphasise the immediate medical significance of their work to the media and granting agencies) emerged in the wake of the Human Genome Project. While occupational health and safety professionals should keep abreast of this rapidly advancing field, use of genomics in the surveillance, monitoring or screening of workers is not practicable at present. The obstacles range from inadequacies in the scientific database to ethical, legal and social implications. This view is in line with the considerations of the European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies.6",1351-0711 1470-7926,-1,openalex,1760,,,,44

A national advisory committee has a key task of providing advice on the protocols for operationalisation of individual causality assessment in this new context. Protocol development involves gathering the best available population-level evidence on causality and using this evidence to determine individual causality. Here, the presumably plausible principle was adopted, which stipulates that uncertainties in individual causality should be weighed in favour of a fast and transparent one-time compensation for (ex-)workers. In monocausal diseases, a limited workplace exposure assessment is considered sufficient to determine whether individual causality is presumably plausible in the Dutch context. For multicausal occupational diseases, individual causality assessment is more complicated. Modelling of existing data on the exposure-response relation helps establish the probability of causation, that is, the risk of the disease attributable to a work-related exposure. This operationalisation, applied in some protocols, makes use of the probability of causation, while being prudent in establishing exposure limits. An example from asbestos and lung cancer is provided in this short report. We propose a pragmatic approach to individual causality assessment of substance-related occupational diseases, considering statistical and diagnostic uncertainties.

The pathognomonic finding is a fibrous mass covering the abdominal aorta and the ureters. Our aim was to clarify the possible role of asbestos exposure in the development of RPF. The hypothesis was based on the ability of asbestos to cause fibrosis in pulmonary and pleural tissue. Methods We undertook a case-control study of 43 patients with the disease (86% of eligible cases) treated in three university hospital districts of Finland in 1990-2001. For every patient, five population-based controls were selected, matched by age, sex, and central hospital district. We assessed asbestos exposure and medical history using a postal questionnaire and a personal interview. Of the 215 eligible controls, 179 (83%) participated in the study. Findings The age-standardised incidence of RPF was 0·10 (95% CI 0·07-0·14) per 100 000 person-years. The disease was strongly associated with asbestos exposure. The odds ratio (OR) was 5·54 (1·64-18·65) for less than 10 fibre-years of asbestos exposure and 8·84 (2·03-38·50) for 10 or more fibre-years, the attributable fraction being 82% and 89%, respectively. Other risk factors were previous use of ergot derivates (OR 9·92 [1·63-60·26]), abdominal aortic aneurysm (OR 6·73 [0·81-56·08]), and smoking for more than 20 pack-years (OR 4·73 [1·28-17·41]).

Previous American Thoracic Society documents have assessed the contribution of workplace exposures to asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on a population level, but not to other chronic respiratory diseases. The goal of this document is to report an in-depth literature review and data synthesis of the occupational contribution to the burden of the major nonmalignant respiratory diseases, including airway diseases; interstitial fibrosis; hypersensitivity pneumonitis; other noninfectious granulomatous lung diseases, including sarcoidosis; and selected respiratory infections. Methods: Relevant literature was identified for each respiratory condition. The occupational population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated for those conditions for which there were sufficient population-based studies to allow pooled estimates. For the other conditions, the occupational burden of disease was estimated on the basis of attribution in case series, incidence rate ratios, or attributable fraction within an exposed group. Results: Workplace exposures contribute substantially to the burden of multiple chronic respiratory diseases, including asthma (PAF, 16%); chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PAF, 14%); chronic bronchitis (PAF, 13%); idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (PAF, 26%); hypersensitivity pneumonitis (occupational burden, 19%); other granulomatous diseases, including sarcoidosis (occupational burden, 30%); pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (occupational burden, 29%); tuberculosis (occupational burden, 2.3% in silica-exposed workers and 1% in healthcare workers); and community-acquired pneumonia in working-age adults (PAF, 10%). Conclusions: Workplace exposures contribute to the burden of disease across a range of nonmalignant lung conditions in adults (in addition to the 100% burden for the classic occupational pneumoconioses). This burden has important clinical, research, and policy implications.

Findings from the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES)",A55,74,,"Introduction and objectives Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) should not be diagnosed in the presence of an identifiable cause. Asbestos is fibrogenic and can cause usual interstitial pneumonia. Occupational asbestos exposure is common in the UK in the population at risk of developing IPF (mostly men in their 70s who have worked in manual occupations). Establishing occupational asbestos exposure in a particular individual, and determining whether or not to attribute causation, is difficult. Our aim was to characterize asbestos exposure in IPF with a view to informing diagnosis. Methods Asbestos exposure was assessed using a job exposure matrix (JEM) based on occupational proportional mortality data for pleural mesothelioma and by means of a validated asbestos exposure reconstruction method for 856 participants (488 cases, 368 controls) from a UK based multicentre hospital-based case-control study, the idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis job exposures study (IPFJES). Results 65% of cases and 63% of controls ever had a high or medium risk (for asbestos exposure) job. Cases spent an average of 24 years (std 17.6, median 21 years) in a high or medium risk job (std 17.1, median 27 years) and controls spent an average of 26 years (std 17.1, median 27 years). 25% of cases and 26% of controls recalled occupational asbestos exposure in sufficient detail to allow exposure reconstruction; mean estimated asbestos exposure was 1129 fibre ml years for cases (std 5663, median 7 fibre ml years) and 586 fibre ml years (std 3194, median 4 fibre ml years) for controls. Conclusions Occupational asbestos exposure is common in patients with IPF and asbestosis is under-diagnosed.

Some of the main lung carcinogens, like silica dust and diesel exhausts, are part of contemporary working environments. Moreover, such exposures were still ten times more frequent among skilled workers than among managers in 2017 in France. Our aim was to quantify the impact of known occupational carcinogens depending on socio-economic position (SEP) in order to integrate exposure inequities into burden of disease estimates. Material and Methods We used the population-based ICARE case-control study that included 2926 lung cancer cases and 3555 frequency-matched controls covering 13% of the French population. Applying the distributive property of attributable risk, we compared the burden of lung cancer according to SEP, taking into account asbestos, silica, diesel motor exhaust (DME), and smoking. We used different modelling strategies to compare R and Stata packages and other sources of variation in the estimates (exposure metrics and SEP indicators). Results  In men, partitioning the attributable fraction by SEP showed that the burden largely concentrated among less qualified and lower SEP groups, even after adjusting for smoking. Based on socio-occupational group, the combined AF (for 3 occupational carcinogens) was as high as 26.7% (95%CI 22.5;30.8) for blue-collar workers and as low as 0.2% (95%CI -1.35;1.64) for managers. The disparities were also large based on education, occupational social prestige and occupational trajectory. The exposure profiles of women did not allow to make reliable estimates.  Conclusions  While attempting to quantify the burden of avoidable lung cancer, it is useful to complement population-wide approaches with a focus on specific sub-groups defined by SEP, as the modifiable exposures (behavioural, work-related and others) are not evenly distributed.",,-1,openalex,1623,,,,51

Several cohort and case-control studies have addressed the issue of occupational risks, mostly among male workers.

PAF and number of attributable cancer cases were calculated using the estimated prevalence, relative risks from systematic review and national estimates of cancer incidence in 2017. The lifetime occupational exposure prevalences were much higher in men than in women ranging from 0.2% (workers in the rubber industry) to 10.2% in men (silica), and from 0.10% (benzene, PAH and workers in the rubber industry) to 5.7% in women (formaldehyde).

The conditions of concern are asbestosis, pleural disorders, and chronic airways obstruction. The criteria are evidence of structural lesion consistent with asbestos-related disease, evidence of causation by asbestos, and exclusion of alternative diagnoses. Findings that satisfy each are described. These guidelines are an extension of the 1986 ATS criteria and expand on them by establishing three explicit criteria, accommodating newer diagnostic modalities, recommending evaluation of impairment appropriate to the diagnosis, and outlining initial management measures following diagnosis. A history of significant asbestos exposure obligates the responsible physician to provide a management plan for the patient that takes into consideration current disease, impairment, and future risk. Persons identified as having asbestos-related disease or having significant exposure histories may benefit from management directed at preserving lung function, preventing complications, reducing the risk of lung cancer, and screening for potentially treatable asbestos-related disease including malignancies. Various issues arising since the publication of the guidelines are addressed, including evidence for pleural plaques being a marker of risk for lung disease apart from history of asbestos exposure; evidence against smoking being associated with a greater frequency of pleural plaques; an association between asbestos exposure and colon cancer; the diagnostic sensitivity of the chest film in smokers; and affirming the adequacy of findings on plain chest films as sufficient for the diagnosis of nonmalignant asbestos-related disease but not always sufficient to rule it out. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.",1068-0640,-1,embase,1159,,,,55

These data contrast with the number of cases currently compensated annually as an occupational disease under the general social insurance system (1,000 to 1,200 cases per year during the last decade, the vast majority of cases being related to previous exposure to asbestos).

Like the layers of an onion, it is a combination of interplay between various pathophysiologic pathways; constitutional factors; individual risk factors and choices; social relationships; living conditions; neighbourhoods and communities; institutions and finally social and economic policies that contribute to injury causation. From the moment we are conceived and especially up to the age of 18 months our nurturing impacts us for the rest of our lives. We have a choice to invest the time and resources when the infant's brain is most malleable or by default continue to spend too late and at a greater cost in social services, welfare, judicial systems and health care expenditures. Without a doubt, our chances of achieving greater health are directly linked to the strengthening of the social determinants of health: genetics, gender, housing, education (literacy), income and social status, personal health practices, resilience, nutrition, employment conditions, physical environment, culture, child development, spirituality and strong social support networks. Our inability to acknowledge the importance of ‘love’ and ‘happiness’ in our lives makes the required new thinking of injuries difficult for the majority of injury prevention leaders. The current desire for instant versus delayed gratification in our society directly leads to the need for an expensive, ineffective health care system. The very actions that give us instant gratificat ion also give rise to disease and injury. Fatty foods give rise to obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and injury. Drug use gives rise to overdoses, addictions, mental illness, crime and injuries. Alcohol use gives rise to cirrhosis, mental illness, violence, injuries and crime. Inactivity gives rise to obesity, poor health, and disability. Salt use gives rise to hypertension and cardiovascular problems. Sex gives rise to sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancies, fetal alcohol syndrome and sexual assaults. Smoking gives rise to cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis and injuries. It is estimated that 50% of all deaths in developed countries are preventable. That for those under the age of 44, injury is the leading cause of death. For those under the age of 34 motor vehicle related injuries are the leading cause of death. And finally, injuries kill more 1–19-year-olds than all other diseases combined. Let us broaden our approach to injury prevention by boldly linking our discussions to include ‘love’, ‘happiness’, ‘instant versus delayed gratification’ and the ‘social determinants of health’ as we search for solutions to this seemingly elusive problem—injuries.",1353-8047 1475-5785,-1,openalex,1783,,,,58

A population-based registry of mesothelioma cases has been established in the Lombardy, Italy, since 2000. We compared exposure history and the main characteristics of PEM and PLM cases diagnosed in the period 2000-2007. Methods: We selected all incident cases in subject residing in Lombardy (period 2000-2007 for PEM, n = 110 and period 2000-2001, n = 515 for PLM). All cases were investigated by an Expert Panel which evaluated clinical records, occupational and residential history, and lifestyle. Differences between PLM and PEM cases were investigated using Fisher exact test. Results: The proportions of cases with occupational or environmental/familial exposures were similar between PEM and PLM cases (50% occupational and 6% environmental), instead the prevalence of subjects with both occupational and environmental/familial exposure was more than doubled among PEM cases (6.4% vs. 2.7%, P = 0.059). PEM cases showed a higher proportion of females (48% vs. 36%) and a higher proportion of subjects with asbestosis and with pleural plaques at the CT scan. No significant differences between PEM and PLM cases were observed regarding age at diagnosis, smoking habits, and level of diagnostic certainty. Conclusion: Our data suggest that asbestos exposure is the main risk factor not only for PLM but also for PEM, and pointed out the importance of mixed occupational and environmental exposure in etiological pathway leading to such a rare but fatal disease, encouraging any efforts to identify unknown sources of exposure in order to ensure public health.",1044-3983,-1,embase,1137,,,,59

The available ""evidence"" was used to develop semiarbitrary evidence-based causation guideline rules for the assessment of putative associations between MM and NOAE. The rules are classified into class A (tissue burden analysis shows asbestos body counts or fiber counts in lung tissues comparable to MM caused by occupational exposure to asbestos) and classes B to D based on whether certain combinations of NOAE features and MM (evidence) have been described in over 15% (class B), 5% to 15% (class C), and less than 5% (class D) of the patients reviewed. The proposed 4 classes of evidence-based causation guidelines provide a semiarbitrary framework to evaluate the causation of individual MM patients by NOAE based on decreasing levels of currently available evidence. The neoplasms in classes A to C patients are probably caused by NOAE, with decreasing weight of evidence in the 3 groups. There is minimal evidence to support the causation of MM by NOAE in class D patients. There is no evidence or only anecdotal evidence to support a causal association between MM and NOAE in individuals who cannot be classified into any of the 4 classes.

This raises social justice issues as those quantification tools are increasingly used for discussing cancer prevention priorities and occupational disease compensation rules. Our general aim was to explore ways by which population health metrics could integrate occupational inequities, and to identify eventual data gaps. Our specific aim was to compare the burden of work-related lung cancer between different socio-economic groups taking into account three known occupational carcinogens (asbestos, silica and DME) and smoking. Methods: We conducted a secondary analysis of the population-based case-control study ICARE (Investigation sur les Cancers Respiratoires et l'Environnement). The study included 2926 lung cancer cases and 3555 frequency-matched controls covering 13% of the French population. Lifelong occupational exposures were assessed by job-exposure matrices and self-report. We compared sources of variation in the attributable fractions (AF) estimates, including interaction with socio-economic position (SEP) and SEP indicator (education or occupation-based), using STATA. Results: The analysis was based on men-only due to the limited number of exposures among women. The AF for the combined indicator of asbestos, silica and DME exposures was 29.4% (95%CI [23.9-34.4]) overall, while the AF for exposed blue-collar workers compared to non-exposed groups regardless of SEP was 26.9% (95%CI [21.9- 31.7]). AFs were slightly higher when capturing SEP through education. Our results provide quantified evidence that the burden of work-related lung cancer attributable to these 3 known carcinogens concentrates massively (over 90%) among manual workers. Conclusion: They exemplify the need for integrating indicators of occupation and industry sector into BOD estimates to inform decision-making in cancer prevention and compensation.

Joinpoint regression analysis and an age-period-cohort (APC) analysis were conducted to estimate the trend of lung cancer burden as a result of occupational carcinogens from 1990 to 2019.

Results: The average annual percentage changes of age-standardized summary exposure values (SEVs) of occupational lung carcinogens, as well as the age-standardized population attributable fraction (PAF) of lung cancer due to occupational carcinogens, were 0.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.4–0.5%) and 0.1% (95% CI: 0–0.2%), respectively. In addition, both the joinpoint regression analysis and APC analysis demonstrated significantly increased trends of age-standardized lung cancer mortality (ASMR) and age-standardized disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) as a result of occupational carcinogens. Asbestos and silica accounted for the two most important occupational lung carcinogens in China. The absolute burden is expected to increase, mainly due to population aging and the age-specific rate of illness.

Although conceptual and validity issues have been widely addressed in the epidemiological literature, there is a paucity of attention on the impact of PAFs in decision-making, and the lack of consideration of factors like work or the environment on population health inequalities. Our aims are, first, to gather published estimates of cancer attributed to causal agents in the workplace over the last decades (past); second, to analyze them from the perspective of their potential effects on population health inequalities research (present); and third, to explore ways by which population health metrics could take occupational inequities into account (future). PAFs of work-related cancer ranged from less than 2% to more than 8%, with an average of 4-5%. While most authors acknowledge that exposures concentrate in lower-socioeconomic status workers, occupational group has never been considered as a source of variation in the calculations. This knowledge gap is linked to the paucity of data describing the occupational patterning of exposures and cancer. More globally, the social gradient in cancer is often interpreted in the light of behavioral factors alone, a tendency linked by historians to the very foundations of modern epidemiology, and that may result in what science studies refer to ""undone science"". Yet, there is accumulated evidence that work affects health and death through different pathways, which are also relevant to cancer inequalities research and prevention. We hence propose to further the discipline's reflexivity by changing the focus, scope and metrics in order to assess the burden of work-related cancer in a way that is more meaningful to the most disadvantaged workers.

Such cancers can be distinguished from those caused by tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking and deliberate sun exposure, together with malignancies for which diet, obesity, exercise, reproductive history, sexual behaviour and the like are risk factors, all often described as cancers associated with lifestyle. Involuntary exposure to carcinogens is best characterised in the workplace. Most of the substances known to be carcinogenic for humans have been identified following epidemiological study of particular workers. Occupational cancer may be prevented by regulation, once carcinogens or hazardous environments have been recognised, despite unacceptable delays in the case of asbestos specifically. Wider pollution of the environment is generally attributable to industrial practice, though arsenic contamination of water supplies in some locations also occurs naturally. Atmospheric pollution causes lung cancer, with worst exposures now involving developing countries. Local pollution by asbestos, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, or heavy metals may cause cancer amongst residents, but clear proof of causation in relation to pesticides, solvents and industrial waste in such situations is difficult. Media attention to cancer allegedly associated with a variety of consumer products (apart from tobacco and alcohol) raises anxiety and expectations.

Asbestos is the most significant carcinogen for occupational lung cancer. Establishing the diagnosis of asbestos-related occupational lung cancer (ARLC) maybe challenging in the presence of tobacco smoking. We report a case of ARLC, review the literature and highlight the clinical guidelines and consensus opinion on the attribution of lung cancer to asbestos exposure. CASE PRESENTATION: A 77 year-old Asian male, a previous smoker of 15 pack-years who quit smoking 20 years ago, was initially referred for bilateral reticular opacities detected on his chest radiograph during health screening. He reported mild shortness of breath on exertion. He had significant workplace exposure to asbestos 50 years ago whilst removing the insulation fibres from the ship boiler. High resolution CT scan showed bilateral subpleural honeycombing and reticular interstitial thickening and multiple calcified pleural plaques. Pulmonary function testing showed restrictive spirometry with reduced lung volumes and reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. He was diagnosed to have asbestosis based on his exposure to asbestos and the clinico-radiologic findings. On follow-up 4 years following his diagnosis of asbestosis, an enlarging rounded right lower zone lesion was noted on his chest radiograph. CT chest revealed a new lobulated mass in the middle lobe. He underwent CT guided biopsy of the lesion which confirmed small cell lung carcinoma. He was diagnosed to have ARLC based on the Helsinki criteria. DISCUSSION: Despite its ban in several countries, asbestos is still widely used in some developing countries. Exposure to asbestos occurs in asbestos repair and removal work. In a patient with lung cancer, the diagnosis of ARLC requires a detailed occupational history and exposure to asbestos. Multidisciplinary discussions between the pulmonologist, radiologist and occupational health physician are often needed. The risk of lung cancer is higher the greater the exposure to asbestos. The presence of asbestosis is an indicator of high asbestos exposure and increases the risk of ARLC in both smokers and nonsmokers. For workers exposed to asbestos who also smoke, the lung cancer risk is even greater than adding the risks from these exposures separately. Pleural plaques are indicators of exposure to asbestos fibres. Because pleural plaques may be associated with low levels of exposure to asbestos fibres, the attribution of lung cancer to asbestos must be supported by an occupational history of substantial asbestos exposure or measures of asbestos fibre burden, which form the basis for the Helsinki criteria.. A review found no difference in the cell type and location between ARLC and non-ARLC. A recent systematic review found occupational exposure to asbestos significantly increases the risk of small cell lung cancer in men. There is limited evidence to guide risk estimation and low dose CT screening in workers at high risk for lung cancer due to asbestos. CONCLUSIONS: Asbestos exposure and tobacco smoking interact synergistically in the causation of lung cancer. Physicians need to be familiar with the criteria for the diagnosis of ARLC and the medico-legal and compensation framework in their jurisdictions. REFERENCE #1: Takala J.

This is especially difficult in cases involving beryllium for which the data on human carcinogenicity are limited and controversial. In this report we present the case of a 73-year-old former technician at a government research facility who was recently diagnosed with lung cancer. The patient is a former smoker who has worked with both beryllium and asbestos. He was referred to the University of California, San Francisco, Occupational and Environmental Medicine Clinic at San Francisco General Hospital for an evaluation of whether past workplace exposures may have contributed to his current disease. The goal of this paper is to provide an example of the use of data-based risk estimates to determine causation in patients with multiple exposures. To do this, we review the current knowledge of lung cancer risks in former smokers and asbestos workers, and evaluate the controversies surrounding the epidemiologic data linking beryllium and cancer. Based on this information, we estimated that the patient's risk of lung cancer from asbestos was less than his risk from tobacco smoke, whereas his risk from beryllium was approximately equal to his risk from smoking. Based on these estimates, the patient's workplace was considered a probable contributing factor to his development of lung cancer.",0091-6765,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex, openalex","1409, 1201, 1571, 1639",,,,73

We read with particular interest Fitzgerald et al’s recent paper that detailed eligibility for lung cancer screening using this method (5). Some observations in France about the related question of asbestos might give further useful insight into complicated questions relevant to lung cancer screening and its financial consequences. In 2010–2011, the French National Authority for Health arbitrated a very broad debate between all interested parties (ie, patients, doctors, scientists, politicians and lobbyists, employers) concerning asbestos in the workplace (6). Chest CT was accepted as the standard imaging procedure (a former recommendation of X-rays was considered useless) to be carried out every 5 or 10 years, depending on the cumulative exposure at work – as assessed by an occupational health specialist – and at 20–30 years after the first year of exposure. This decision was based on the currently available medical evidence, but also on financial consequences, taking two aspects into consideration. First, all asbestos disorders diagnosed might be compensated, from cancer to asbestosis, this comprises all pleural disorders related to asbestos exposure, including plaques (based on the subsequent anxiety, and the higher probability of later cancer) (7); and a follow-up by a specialist is offered, taking into account the possibility of complications from “too much medicine” including aspecific pulmonary nodules) (8, 9). The second aspect was the asbestos companies’ funding of consequences, based on the attributable fraction of risk in exposed individuals and populations. Thus, we encourage consideration of the possibility of involving all stakeholders who might play a role in the etiology of lung cancer (directly or indirectly, asbestos and also tobacco companies), in order to decide who should assume the charges for all consequences of such screening.

Because of their prevalence and commercial applications, they have been widely studied for their potential to induce pulmonary fibrosis and other disorders. Historically, the focus in the workplace has been on the development of inflammation and fibrotic lung disease, the basis for promulgating workplace standards to protect workers. Crystalline silica (CS) polymorphs, predominantly quartz and cristobalite, are used in industry but are different in their mineralogy, chemistry, surface features, size dimensions and association with other elements naturally and during industrial applications. Epidemiologic, clinical and experimental studies in the literature historically have predominantly focused on quartz polymorphs. Thus, in this review, we summarize past scientific evaluations and recent peer-reviewed literature with an emphasis on cristobalite, in an attempt to determine whether quartz and cristobalite polymorphs differ in their health effects, toxicity and other properties that may dictate the need for various standards of protection in the workplace. In addition to current epidemiological and clinical reports, we review in vivo studies in rodents as well as cell culture studies that shed light on mechanisms intrinsic to the toxicity, altered cell responses and protective or defense mechanisms in response to these minerals. The medical and scientific literature indicates that the mechanisms of injury and potential causation of inflammation and fibrotic lung disease are similar for quartz and cristobalite. Our analysis of these data suggests similar occupational exposure limits (OELs) for these minerals in the workplace. © 2013 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.",1040-8444 and 1547-6898,-1,embase,1100,,,,80
194,1614,Heihachiro ARITO,2015,Industrial Health,10.2486/indhealth.53-193,Risk assessment of hazardous substances revisited,193-195,53,3,"It is needless for occupational health doctors and scientists to mention about the importance of risk assessment of hazardous substances used in workplaces. Since the US Supreme Court sentenced the “benzene verdict” requiring better ground for the occupational exposure limit (OEL) for benzene in 1980, the research and scientific knowledge on risk assessment for hazardous substances have been greatly advanced, and the concept of risk for hazardous substances used in workplaces has been introduced into the field of occupational health. Since then, many hazardous substances have been reevaluated for effects on worker health in light of the risk assessment approach. In particular, the occupational health standards for occupational carcinogens are noteworthy. The Japan Society for Occupational Health (JSOH) recommends the reference values of 1 ppm and 0.1 ppm for benzene, corresponding to individual excess lifetime risks of cancer of 1 × 10−3 and 1 × 10−4, respectively, on the basis of the average relative risk model, instead of the conventional OEL value. The JSOH also recommends the reference values for other occupational carcinogens including arsenic and its compounds (as As), asbestos and nickel smelting dusts (as Ni) as well as ionizing radiation. A characteristic feature of these carcinogenic reference values is that they are expressed as occupational standard concentrations with an excess lifetime cancer risk level of 1/1,000 or 1/10,000. It was thus suggested that there is no threshold level for induction of cancer in comparison with noncarcinogenic compounds having a threshold level below which there is no risk of any adverse health effect.Recently in Japan, we had two tragic incidents that raised serious concerns regarding the health of workers handling two hazardous substances, i.e., indium and 1,2-dichloropropane (DCP). The first was 10 cases of lung diseases attributable to occupational exposure to indium and its compounds reported in Japan as of 2010, including 7 cases of interstitial pneumonia. In 2010, the Japan Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) issued a Technical Guideline for Preventing Health Impairment of Workers Engaged in the Indium-Tin Oxides Handling Processes. In order to protect workers from excessive exposure to indium and its compounds in workplaces, employers are required to implement actions and measures by assessing workplace air concentrations of indium-containing respirable dust, using two occupational standards. The MHLW established the two standards: a target concentration of indium in respirable dust of 0.01 mg In/m3 and an acceptable exposure limit of indium of 0.0003 mg In/m3. The latter value was derived on the basis of the quantitative carcinogenic risk assessment approach, using the dose-response data obtained from an 104-wk carcinogenic and chronic toxicity study showing a significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer in rats in close association with various pathological changes including chronic fibrosis in the lung of rats and mice1). The second incident involved male offset color proof-printing workers at a small company in Osaka, who were exposed to high levels of DCP and dichloromethane vapor, and diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma2). Several printing workers died of bile duct cancer. The MHLW revised the administrative control level (ACL) of DCP from 10 ppm to 1 ppm, designating this substance as a possible occupational carcinogen in accordance with the Industrial Safety and Health (ISH) Act. The JSOH also recommended an OEL value of 1 ppm for 1,2-dichloropropane, classifying this substance as Group 1 (confirmed human carcinogen with epidemiological evidence).In view of the astonishing occurrence of these two incidents of fatal occupational diseases in the first decade of the 21st century in Japan, more comprehensive countermeasures to cope with these difficult situations were urgently needed for regulation of hazardous substances, in particular carcinogenic substances. In 2014, the National Diet of Japan passed the amended ISH Act, and the MHLW amended the ISH-related laws and regulations such as the Ordinance on Prevention of Hazards due to Specified Chemical Substances (OPHSC) and the Ordinance on Prevention of Organic Solvent Poisoning. These two ordinances were amended to implement more strict regulatory control of carcinogenic substances used in workplaces. These substances are chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, 1,4-dioxane, 1,2-dichloroethane, dichloromethane, styrene, 1,1,2,2-tetrachloroethane, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene, methyl isobutyl ketone, ethylbenzene, and 1,2-dichloropropane, all of which are classified as carcinogens of Groups 1 (human carcinogen with epidemiological evidence), 2A (probable human carcinogen), or 2B (possible human carcinogen) by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). For instance, the OPHSC stipulates that workers handling these substances or mixtures having 1% or more of them in workplaces must have a medical examination once every 6 months, and that the workplace air concentrations of these substances must be measured once every 6 months in accordance with the analytical methods designated by the Working Environment Measurement Act. Importantly, the data from both the medical examination and work environmental measurements must be preserved for 30 years, since these substances are known to induce occupational cancer after a long latency period. The ISH-related ordinance designates 37 substances including the abovementioned 12 organic solvents as the carcinogens termed as “special control substances”. It is, however, thought that the number of occupational carcinogens regulated by the ISH-related laws is too small as compared with those that are not regulated by the laws. In contrast, the JSOH recommends a total of 176 substances as occupational carcinogens of Groups 1 (confirmed human carcinogen), 2A (probable human carcinogen), and 2B (possible human carcinogen). The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommends 132 substances as occupational carcinogens. Additionally, the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recommends 139 substances as carcinogens classified as A1 (confirmed human carcinogen), A2 (suspected human carcinogen), and A3 (confirmed animal carcinogen with unknown relevance to humans). The recent amendment of the OPHSC seems to be an important step toward reduction of occupational cancers. However, we have to cope with many other carcinogenic substances used in workplaces that are not regulated by the ISH-related laws and regulations. Now, employers are effectively required to take initiative to control many other occupational carcinogens that are not regulated by the ISH-related laws. At present, we have to rely on a lot of information about carcinogenicity of hazardous substances coming from the USA and Europe.Another feature of the recent OPHSC amendment is that employers are obligated to assess health risks of hazardous substances used in workplaces in light of an appropriate risk assessment approach. For instance, employers must provide information about safety and health effects of hazardous substances and methods of handling these substances in the form of a Safety Data Sheet (SDS) in accordance with the global harmonization standard (GHS). When these hazardous substances are used and handled in workplaces, employers must provide the SDSs for the substances listed in the OPHSC. There are a total of 640 substance that the OHPSC asks employers to provide SDS for, not only for the transaction of materials from suppliers to recipients but also for appropriate control of work environment, in order to protect workers from occupational diseases resulting from excessive exposure to these substances. Many occupational carcinogens are included in the list of 640 substances. The ACGIH recommends OEL values for these 640 substances. The NIOSH establishes the Recommended Exposure Limits (RELs) for 586 substances. In Germany, MAK values (maximum workplace concentrations) have been recommended for 340 hazardous substances without carcinogenicity in addition to 163 occupational carcinogens classified as Categories 1 (human carcinogens) and 2 (probable human carcinogens). On the other hand, the JSOH recommends OELs for 220 substances. The MHLW established ACLs only for 91 substances. The differences in the number of hazardous substances recommended or regulated by laws between Japan and the USA or Europe suggest that we rely on a lot of information about various health effects coming from the USA and Europe, and that much more efforts should be made by employers of Japanese enterprises to cope effectively with the requirements imposed by the recently amended ISH-related law and regulations. As it was for the “benzene verdict” 35 years ago in the USA, it is now time in Japan for the agenda concerning risk assessment of hazardous substances to be revisited. In order to fulfill the regulatory requirements imposed by the recently amended OPHSC and to cope adequately with the present circumstances, employers of Japanese enterprises, government, and academia have to study together and work together. Effective cooperation among these three stakeholders will promote worker health and prevention of occupational diseases through appropriate implementation of risk assessment for many hazardous substances used in workplaces.",0019-8366 1880-8026,-1,openalex,1614,,,,81

We estimated the cost of production losses due to morbidity (absenteeism and presenteeism) and mortality costs (years of production losses) in the market and nonmarket spheres. The social cost of lung, larynx, sinonasal and mesothelioma cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, chromium, diesel engine exhaust, paint, crystalline silica, wood and leather dust in France in 2010 were estimated at between 917 and 2,181 million euros.

Methods: We used the results of China from Global Burden of Disease Study 2013, according to the correlation between death of NCDs and exposure of risk factors and the comparative risk assessment theory, to calculate population attributable fraction (PAF) and disaggregate deaths of NCDs into parts attributable and un-attributable. We used proportional change model to project risk factors exposure and un-attributable deaths of NCDs in 2030, then to get deaths of NCDs in 2030. Simulated scenarios according to the goals of global main NCDs risk factors control proposed by WHO were constructed to calculate the impact of risk factors control on NCDs death, life expectancy and the numbers of labor force lost. Results: If the risk factors exposure changed according to the trend of 1990 to 2013, compared to the numbers (8.499 million) and mortality rate (613.5/100 000) of NCDs in 2013, the death number (12.161 million) and mortality rate (859.2/100 000) would increase by 43.1% and 40.0% respectively in 2030, among which, ischemic stroke (increasing by 103.3% for death number and 98.8% for mortality rate) and ischemic heart disease (increasing by 85.0% for death number and 81.0% for mortality rate) would increase most quickly. If the risk factors get the goals in 2030, the NCDs deaths would reduce 2 631 thousands. If only one risk factor gets the goal, blood pressure (1 484 thousands NCDs deaths reduction), smoking (717 thousands reduction) and BMI (274 thousands reduction) would be the most important factors affecting NCDs death. Blood pressure control would have greater impact on ischemic heart disease (662 thousands reduction) and hemorrhagic stroke (449 thousands reduction). Smoking control would have the greatest effect on lung cancer (251 thousands reduction) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (201 thousands reduction). BMI control would have the greatest impact on ischemic heart disease (86 thousands reduction) and hypertensive heart disease (45 thousands reduction). If the risk factors exposure changed according to the trend of 1990 to 2013, in 2030, the life expectancy of Chinese population would reach to 79.0 years old, compared to 2013, increasing by 3.3 years old, the labor force at the age of 15-64 years old would loss 1.932 million. If the risk factors get the goals in 2030, life expectancy would increase to 81.7 years old and the number of labor force lost would decrease to 1.467 million. Blood pressure, smoking and BMI control would have much greater impact on life expectancy (4.9, 4.0 and 3.8 years old respectively) and labor force lost (630 thousands, 496 thousands and 440 thousands respectively). Conclusion: Risk factors control would play an important role in reducing NCD death, improving life expectancy of residents and reducing loss of labor force. Among them, the control of blood pressure raising, smoking and BMI raising would have a greater contribution to the improvement of population health status.",0253-9624,-1,pubmed,1323,,,,87

Methods: More than 2,500 patients have been prospectively registered at 137 randomly selected practice sites. Primary outcomes included documented severe neutropenia (SN) (ANC<500), NC ( fever/ infection/other) and severe neutropenic events (SNE) (SN or NC). Results: This preliminary analysis is based on the first 2,222 patients treated to date including 886 (40%) age ≥ 65. One-third did not receive at least four cycles of chemotherapy due to disease progression (55%), refusal (11%), death (11%) and unknown (23%). Neutropenia (ANC <1000) was documented in 40% including SN in 26%. More than one-half of all initial events occurred during cycle 1. In addition to cancer and regimen type, significant predictors of SN included gender (.001), baseline neutrophils (.01), diabetes (.037) and chronic lung disease (.001).

This study reviewed the international trend, usage, and critiques of the PC method. Because it has been used in Korea, it is important to check the present status and estimation of PC in radiation-related cancers in Korea. Methods: Research articles and official reports regarding PC of radiation-related cancer and published from the 1980s onwards were reviewed, including studies used for the revision of the Korean PC program. PC has been calculated for compensation-related cases in Korea since 2005. Results: The United States National Institutes of Health first estimated the PC in 1985. Among the 106 occupational diseases listed in the International Labor Organization Recommendation 194 (International Labor Office (ILO), ILO List of Occupational Diseases, 2010), PC is available only for occupational cancer after ionizing radiation exposure. The United States and United Kingdom use PC as specific criteria for decisions on the compensability of workers' radiation-related health effects. In Korea, PC was developed firstly as Korean Radiation Risk and Assigned Share (KORRAS) in 1999. In 2015, the Occupational Safety and Health Research Institute and Radiation Health Research Institute jointly developed a more revised PC program, Occupational Safety and Health-PC (OSH-PC). Between 2005 and 2015, PC was applied in 16 claims of workers' compensation for radiation-related cancers. In most of the cases, compensation was given when the PC was more than 50%. However, in one case, lower than 50% PC was accepted considering the possibility of underestimation of the cumulative exposure dose. Conclusions: PC is one of the most advanced tools for estimating the causation of occupational cancer. PC has been adjusted for baseline cancer incidence in Korean workers, and for uncertainties using a statistical method. Because the fundamental reason for under- or over-estimation is probably inaccurate dose reconstruction, a proper guideline is necessary.",2052-4374,-1,embase,1060,,,,89

It is increasingly being recognized as the most common malignancy in males in many hospitals of India. In addition to smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens, indoor air pollution and dietary factors have recently been implicated in the causation of lung cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is still the most common histological type in India in contrast to the Western countries, although adenocarcinoma is becoming more common.[1] Lung cancers are common after 50 years of age, which poses a challenge for pulmonologist to diagnose. Sputum cytology and non-invasive diagnostic methods are quite insufficient in accurate diagnosis. In such cases, transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) with flexible bronchoscopy proves to be a useful tool for diagnosing lung cancer accurately.[23] Our aim and objectives was to study the clinico-radiological profile of suspected cases of lung cancer and its correlation with fiber-optic TBNA and cytological analysis. Forty patients with suspicion of lung cancer attending chest out-patient department from June, 2011 to November, 2011 were evaluated with chest X-ray and contrast enhanced computed tomography. Suspected cases were further evaluated with flexible bronchoscopy and TBNA and cytopathological analysis. Flexible bronchoscopy helped in confirmatory diagnosis of 75% cases of carcinoma lung, out of which most of the cases were that of adenocarcinoma (54%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (16%). In 25% cases, it was in favor of inflammatory pathology. Males (80%) were more susceptible to develop lung cancer in comparison with females (20%) and 63% of total cases were in the age group of 51-70 years. Complete clinical examination of suspected lung cancer patients revealed that most common sign associated with development of lung cancer was clubbing (48%), followed by pleural effusion (15%), facial puffiness (13%), lymphadenopathy (13%), lung collapse (13%), bony tenderness (8%), superior vena caval obstruction (5%) and change in voice (4%). Radiological findings suggested higher prevalence of tumor mass shadows (60%), with lung collapse seen in 38% of cases followed by metastases (30%), hilar prominence (25%), diaphragm paralysis (20%), pleural effusion, loculated cavity and rib erosion in 13% of the cases. Most reliable bronchoscopic signs of carcinoma lung were widened carina and bronchial lumen narrowing (25%) followed by endobronchial growth (20%), mucosal hyperemia bleed on touch (13%) and vocal cord paralysis (10%).

PATHOL,,Controversies and uncertainties concerning the pathologic features and pathologic diagnosis of asbestosis,102-109,9,2,"Asbestos is a fibrous silicate mineral that has been known for decades to cause pulmonary scarring, referred to as asbestosis. The simplest definition of asbestosis is the presence of pulmonary fibrosis as a result of accumulation of airborne asbestos in the lungs. Not infrequently, the terms 'asbestos' and 'asbestosis' are used incorrectly (interchangeably) by medical personnel, and sometimes pleural fibrosis caused by asbestos is incorrectly referred to as asbestosis. The earliest lesion of asbestosis, as defined by the CAP-NIOSH Committee is peribronchiolar fibrosis, although controversy exists as to how specific this lesion is with respect to causation by asbestos, and whether this lesion progresses to grade 4 asbestosis. In addition, some authorities in the field suggest that the term 'asbestosis' be used only for diffuse interstitial fibrosis. The mechanism by which asbestos causes interstitial fibrosis remains poorly understood, and in recent years, pathologic changes such as organizing pneumonitis-bronchiolitis obliterans, and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, have been described in persons occupationally exposed to asbestos, suggesting that the pulmonary lesions caused by asbestos represent a wider spectrum than had previously been appreciated.

Attributable incidence estimates are 13 679 (4.0%) cancer registrations (men, 10 063 (5.7%); women, 3616 (2.2%)). Occupational attributable fractions are over 2% for mesothelioma, sinonasal, lung, nasopharynx, breast, non-melanoma skin cancer, bladder, oesophagus, soft tissue sarcoma, larynx and stomach cancers. Asbestos, shift work, mineral oils, solar radiation, silica, diesel engine exhaust, coal tars and pitches, occupation as a painter or welder, dioxins, environmental tobacco smoke, radon, tetrachloroethylene, arsenic and strong inorganic mists each contribute 100 or more registrations. Industries and occupations with high cancer registrations include construction, metal working, personal and household services, mining, land transport, printing/publishing, retail/hotels/restaurants, public administration/defence, farming and several manufacturing sectors. 56% of cancer registrations in men are attributable to work in the construction industry (mainly mesotheliomas, lung, stomach, bladder and non-melanoma skin cancers) and 54% of cancer registrations in women are attributable to shift work (breast cancer). This project is the first to quantify in detail the burden of cancer and mortality due to occupation specifically for Britain. It highlights the impact of occupational exposures, together with the occupational circumstances and industrial areas where exposures to carcinogenic agents occurred in the past, on population cancer morbidity and mortality; this can be compared with the impact of other causes of cancer.

As a case study, the process by which silica dust was judged a known human carcinogen by IARC is reviewed. Silicosis is a chronic occupational lung disease known to be caused by inhaling crystalline silica, and the pulmonary cancer risk after the diagnosis of silicosis is a part of the IARC review of evidence. Laboratory animal evidence and mechanistic findings supporting IARC evaluation are also described. There remains a need to explore the association between silica exposure and other nonlung tumors, especially gastrointestinal cancers. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) developed a new regulatory standard that lowered the permissible exposure to 50ug/m3 in 2016. OSHA labeled silica as a known human carcinogen because of the IARC assessment. Occupational medicine leaders need to address several current silica dust problems such as silicosis/coal workers pneumoconiosis among coal miners, acute silicosis and auto-immune diseases among countertop workers, and intervention programs to lower silico-tuberculosis among South African miners.

YOUR OBSERVATION is correct that there is a sharp drop in the reported 50th and 84th percentile urinary excretion of 239Pu at the Hanford site starting in the early 1980s. On 10 September 1981, the site practice changed from recording 0.025 dpm per sample to indicate a nondetectable value, to recording the exact result as measured. Because the data were no longer left-censored after this time, the fitted geometric mean and standard deviations for this and subsequent years were substantially reduced. Given increasing awareness of the emotional consequences of radiation-related disasters, what are you doing to deal with this phenomenon? Although the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) does not have a formal program in place to provide emotional counseling to claimants, we have established a number of avenues for workers and claimants to personally communicate the facts of their case and to voice their concerns and frustrations. As part of the NIOSH dose reconstruction (DR) process, each claimant is provided a single point of contact within NIOSH to deal with their case. In addition, prior to the initiation of a DR, each claimant is interviewed to obtain any information that might be relevant to the case. Claimants are also provided the opportunity to voice their concerns during scheduled public comment sessions during routine meetings of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health. Finally, NIOSH participates in town hall meetings that are regularly scheduled by the U.S. Department of Labor to discuss newly added Special Exposure Cohort sites. How has the increased number of people in the “Special Exposure Cohorts” impacted the compensation program? The Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICPA) made provisions for certain classes of employees to be added to what is called the Special Exposure Cohort (SEC). Under certain conditions, workers in the SEC class do not require dose reconstructions for any of 22 cancers. In general, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health finds that about 60% of the cases in a designated class do not require dose reconstruction. Thus, the direct effect of adding a class to the SEC is a reduction in the number of dose reconstructions that must be completed for a site. For those cases with lung cancer, was the additive or multiplicative effect of smoking or radon exposure considered? The effect of smoking on the development of lung cancer is explicitly considered in the probability of causation calculation. Because there is uncertainty about the nature of the interaction between smoking and radiation exposure, the excess relative risk per sievert is adjusted using an uncertainty distribution with various weights given to the additive or multiplicative interaction. The adjustment for the interaction between radon exposure and smoking is also considered, but this adjustment, which relies on data collected from uranium miner studies, gives greater weight to the multiplicative interaction. A detailed discussion of these adjustments can be found in an article by Kocher et al. (2008). How has the confounding factor of x-rays for tuberculosis screening or to serve as a baseline to assess potential later bone damage been evaluated, and how does this influence epidemiological studies? As mentioned in the presentation, the radiation exposure associated with diagnostic x-rays is included in a worker’s dose reconstruction, as long as it was required as a condition of employment. Thus, if these types of x-rays were required, they would be included in the worker’s total occupational exposure. While our division within the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is not engaged in occupational epidemiologic studies, it would be important to consider exposure associated with these types of x-rays in risk studies. Can the reconstructed doses developed for compensation be credibly recalculated for use in epidemiological studies? It is believed that the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has collected sufficient data so that the doses reconstructed for compensation purposes could be recalculated for use in epidemiological studies. This would, of course, require additional funding that is beyond the scope of our current mission. Are attorneys involved in compensation activities? Yes, attorneys do represent some claimants within the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program (EEOICPA). QUESTIONS FOR ANDRE BOUVILLE What are the main factors that resulted in the maximum individual exposures being so different in the four largest nuclear accidents (Windscale, Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima)? The four accidents were very different. The steam explosion at Chernobyl resulted in the loss of the containment and in a series of fires that had to be extinguished quickly. This is the reason for the very high radiation doses received during the first day of the accident. At Fukushima, the reason for the high exposures has not been provided officially (as far as I know), but it seems that air mainly contaminated with 131I found its way to the reactor control room, where the workers were not equipped with respirators and had not taken potassium-iodide tablets. At Three Mile Island, the exposure situation was well managed, so that the maximum doses were relatively low. I am not familiar enough with the Windscale accident to explain why the maximum doses to the workers were also relatively low. What fraction of the total Chernobyl liquidator workforce was actively monitored for radiation dose? I do not think that there is any published information on this topic. According to unpublished information, ~15–20% of the Chernobyl workforce was actively monitored by means of personal dosimeters. The other two methods that were used to determine dose at the time of exposure were: (1) the group assessment method (a personal dosimeter was worn by one member of a group of liquidators assigned to perform a particular task, and all members of the group were given the same dose); and (2) the calculation method (the dose to a group of liquidators was calculated in advance from the dose rate at the work location and the planned duration of work). Altogether, 48% of the workers had a recorded dose (UNSCEAR 2010/2011).

Methods A population-based case-referent study was carried out during 2004-6. Full occupational histories and other information of 1208 male lung cancer incident cases and 1069 agematched male community referents were obtained. Specific or group of agents of confirmed or suspected occupational carcinogens were collected according to a standardised checklist. Results After adjustment for smoking and other potential confounding factors, a significantly increased OR of lung cancer was observed for workers employed in the 'construction' industry (1.51, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.04; ISIC code: 5) and the occupation of 'bricklayers, carpenters and other construction workers' (1.63, 1.20 to 2.22; ISCO code: 9-5). Significantly elevated ORs were associated with exposures to silica dust (2.06, 1.40 to 3.04), welding fumes (1.73, 1.15 to 2.63), spray painting (1.57, 1.00 to 2.47), diesel exhaust (2.16, 1.26 to 3.70), and man-made mineral fibres (8.56, 1.86 to 39.39); while a significantly reduced OR (0.56, 0.40 to 0.78) was linked to cotton dust. Because both the cases and community referents were a representative sample of the general population, we estimated that 4.34% (95% CI: 1.06 to 8.47%) of lung cancer in Hong Kong male population was attributable to the employment of construction industry (prevalence in the referents: 8.9%) and the population attributable fraction was 11.73% (95% CI: 6.66 to 17.71%) for exposures to any of the 5 identified occupational lung carcinogens (prevalence: 18%).

Many occupational carcinogens or exposure situations are identified as definite carcinogens with an excess of lung cancers in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. A recent study reported a 14.6% attributable risk fraction to work for this cancer site in France, which would amount to more than 5,900 annual cases. Asbestos is the most common occupational risk factor involved in lung cancer, with an estimated 9.3% attributable fraction in humans, or 2,715 cases in France. However, at the same time, less than 1100 cases of lung cancer per year are compensated annually as an occupational disease under the general social insurance system. It is therefore essential to identify the nuisances and occupational exposure situations involved in the lung cancer, in order to put in place effective prevention strategies and close monitoring of potentially exposed employees. Finally, for a patient presenting with lung cancer, the identification of a relationship with his professional activity must be systematically sought, in order to allow him to take possible medicallegal steps for compensation of his disease, or additional request to the Compensation Fund for Asbestos Victims (FIVA) and to request a possible early termination of activity for asbestos exposure situations. 1877-1203/© 2022 SPLF.

However, to date no clinical level of evidence 1 has been provided for any of the many radiomics signatures published in the literature. The purpose of this study is to provide that evidence by prospectively validating a prognostic radiomics signature for chemoradiotherapy lung cancer patients [1]. Methods: A total of 228 chemoradiotherapy lung cancer patients were collected from the observational SDC lung clinical trial (NCT01855191). Tumour volumes within the CT scans of these patients were segmented automatically using a deep learning model (validated DICE agreement with oncologists of 0.88) and used as input to the radiomics signature. The primary outcome was overall survival. The signature was used to classify patients as responders or non-responders (high/low score based on of the threshold proposed by Aerts et al.). Predefined statistical tests were performed to prospectively validate the performance of the model. Results: Discrimination of the model was assessed by Harrell’s concordance index (c-index = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.59-0.70). Kaplan-Meier survival curves differed significantly between responders/non-responders (log-rank test; p = 0.002). The calibration slope (β) on the linear predictor of the signature in a Cox proportional hazards model was 1.27 (H0: β = 1, p = 0.37), indicating a valid relative risk model. A joint test of the coefficients of the individual variables of the signature (p = 0.028) indicated that the performance in the prospective validation cohort could be improved by adjusting the model coefficients. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge this study demonstrates the first clinical evidence level 1 for any radiomics signature. This has implications for the wider field as it demonstrates that other signatures could also be prospectively validated. This signature could be practically used as a clinical decision support tool to evaluate the likelihood of response to chemoradiotherapy, or as a stratification tool in future clinical trials.

In 1997, a group of experts developed the Helsinki Criteria, which established criteria for attribution of mesothelioma to asbestos. The criteria include two methods for causation attribution: 1) a history of significant occupational, domestic, or environmental exposure and/or 2) pathologic evidence of exposure to asbestos. In 2014, the Helsinki Criteria were updated, and these attribution criteria were not changed. However, since the Helsinki Criteria were first released in 1997, some pathologists, cell biologists, and others have claimed that a history of exposure cannot establish causation unless the lung asbestos fiber burden exceeds ""the background range for the laboratory in question to attribute mesothelioma cases to exposure to asbestos."" This practice ignores the impact on fiber burden of clearance/translocation over time, which in part is why the Helsinki Criteria concluded that a history of exposure to asbestos was independently sufficient to attribute causation to asbestos. After reviewing the Helsinki Criteria, we conclude that their methodology is fatally flawed because a quantitative assessment of a background lung tissue fiber level cannot be established. The flaws of the Helsinki Criteria are both technical and substantive. The 1995 paper that served as the scientific basis for establishing background levels used inconsistent methods to determine exposures in controls and cases. In addition, historic controls cannot be used to establish background fiber levels for current cases because ambient exposures to asbestos have decreased over time and control cases pre-date current cases by decades. The use of scanning electron microscope (SEM) compounded the non-compatibility problem; the applied SEM cannot distinguish talc from anthophyllite because it cannot perform selected area electron diffraction, which is a crucial identifier in ATEM for distinguishing the difference between serpentine asbestos, amphibole asbestos, and talc.",2214-9996,-1,pubmed,1303,,,,102

(1974).British Journal of Industrial Medicine,31, 91-104. Mesothelioma Register 1967-68. A register of mesothelioma cases is maintained by the Department of Employment, Medical Services Division (now Employment Medical Advisory Service). This paper describes an investigation of 413 notifications to the Register in 1967-68 from England and Wales and Scotland. Cases were regarded as `definite' when histological confirmation of diagnosis had been obtained, either by hospital pathologists, or by the UICC Panel of Pathologists, to whom pathological material was submitted whenever possible. Two hundred and forty-six cases were accepted as `definite' and 76 cases were regarded as `definitely not' mesothelioma. The remainder were classified as `undecided' or `insufficient pathological material'. Thirty-five of the 76 cases definitely not mesothelioma had nevertheless been so described on death certificates. The investigation carried out covers clinical aspects, survival, and evidence of exposure to asbestos. Twelve per cent of definite mesotheliomata were of peritoneal origin. The age range was 21 to 87 years, but, in general, mesothelioma occured at an earlier age than `carcinoma of bronchus and lung' or `all malignant tumours' in the Registrar General's statistical mortality tables. Concomitant asbestosis and the finding of asbestos bodies or pleural plaques occured as frequently in those cases classified as definitely not mesothelioma as in confirmed cases. Occupational exposure to asbestos was found in 68% of definite cases, apparently significantly more frequently than in those definitely not mesothelioma, but there was observer bias. The interval between the first exposure and death from mesothelioma exceeded 25 years in 85% of cases but was only three and a half years in one case. The duration of exposure varied widely: in 12% of cases it was under five years. The type of asbestos could be ascertained in so few cases that it was impossible to asses the rôle of crocidolite in aetiology. There were 38 definite cases in which no history of any exposure to asbestos could be obtained. Definite mesotheliomata showed marked clustering in areas where there is substantial industrial use of asbestos. Whether this should be interpreted as evidence of causation or an effect of heightened awareness in these areas cannot be deduced from this study. Evidence is quoted suggesting that the observed annual incidence of approximately 120 definite mesotheliomata in England, Scotland, and Wales may considerably understate the true prevalence.",0007-1072,-1,"pubmed, embase","1499, 1288",,,,103

MethodNumbers of compensated incident cancers (between 2005–2007) and cancer deaths (between 1997–2005) were obtained from the Quebec Workers’ Compensation Board. A second series of estimates was calculated by applying proportions of cancers attributable to work published for Finland (Nurminen and Karjalainen 2001) and for the United Kingdom (Rushton and colleagues 2012) to Quebec tumour registry data for 28 cancer sites. A comparison of industrial profiles of Finland, United Kingdom and Canada showed reasonable similarities between the countries over the last decades. Results Compensation statistics reported an annual average of 94 incident cancers and 40 cancer deaths (98–99% men), 60–64% of which being mesotheliomas, followed by respiratory cancers (30–37%). Using published estimates of attributable fractions, it was estimated that 6.0% of incident cancers (men, 9.1%; women, 2.7%) and 7.6% of cancer deaths (men, 11.7%; women, 2.8%) could be attributable to work, resulting annually in 2200 new cancers and 1200 deaths. Incident cancers of the lungs, prostate, bladder, skin and breast (women) were the most numerous, whereas cancer sites resulting in more deaths were lung, breast (women) and mesothelium. On average, 53% of incident mesothelioma cases were compensated yearly. Conclusions This attempt at better estimating, albeit imperfectly, importance of the burden of cancer from occupational exposures can help prioritise research activities and increase stakeholders’ awareness. However, better estimates of human impact and economic costs are warranted to justify large investments in preventive interventions.",1351-0711 1470-7926,-1,openalex,1721,,,,104

Subjects were patients who received a thoracic CT scan at Persahabatan Hospital, Jakarta. The cases had primary lung cancer confirmed by histology, the controls were negative for lung cancer. The cumulative occupational asbestos exposure was calculated by multiplying the exposure intensity by the years of exposure. The exposure intensity was obtained by adopting the weighted arithmetic mean value of asbestos exposure from a job-exposure matrix developed in Korea. The primary data analysis was based on logistic regression. The study included 696 subjects, with 336 cases and 360 controls. The chance of lung cancer for subjects exposed to asbestos was doubled (OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.21-3.42) compared with unexposed, and subjects with a cumulative asbestos exposure of 10 fiber-years or more even showed an OR of 3.08 (95% CI = 1.01-9.46). The OR of the combined effect between smoking and asbestos was 8.7 (95% CI = 1.71-44.39); the interaction was consistent with an additive and multiplicative risk model.

In order to explore whether observed association between silica exposure and lung cancer is confounded by exposure to other occupational carcinogens, we updated a previously nested case-control study among a cohort of male workers in 29 Chinese mines and factories on the basis of an extended follow-up. Five hundred and eleven lung cancer cases and 1,879 matched controls were selected. Exposure to respirable silica as well as relevant occupational confounders were quantitatively assessed based on historical industrial hygiene data. The relationship between exposure to silica and lung cancer was analyzed by conditional logistic regression analysis adjusted for exposure to arsenic, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), radon, and smoking. In a crude analysis adjusted for smoking only, a significant trend of increasing risk of lung cancer with exposure to silica was found for tin, iron/copper miners, and pottery workers. But after adjustment for relevant occupational confounders, no relationship between silica and lung cancer can be observed. Instead, there is a significant association between lung cancer mortality and cumulative exposure to inorganic arsenic (OR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.14, 3.04 for each mg/m(3)-year increase) and carcinogenic PAHs (OR = 1.35, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.69 for each 100 microg/m(3)-year increase).

This is, in particular, the case in developing countries and economies in transition. For a better picture for national and international decision making, globally available data sources were studied and analyzed. Methods Employment figures, reported fatal accident rates, mortality data on different diseases and injuries, and attributable fractions identified in the literature for diseases shown to be related to work were used to analyze global occupational accident data and information available on work-related diseases covering most countries. Results A midpoint of 2.2 million was estimated for fatalities occurring worldwide annually due to work-related factors. The most significant problems identified were work-related cancer (in particular, in industrialized countries), occupational accidents (rapidly industrializing countries), work-related cardiovascular diseases, work-related communicable diseases (tropical developing countries), and work-related lung diseases in countries where mining is a major activity (such as China, Vietnam, South Africa, and the like). In addition, 270 million nonfatal occupational accidents and 160 million work-related diseases were estimated to occur every year.

Many cases of OA are missed or delayed, leading to ongoing exposure to the causative agent and avoidable lung function loss and poor employment-related outcomes. Enquiry about work-related symptoms and the nature of work by healthcare professionals (HCPs) is limited, evident in primary and secondary care. Potential reasons cited for this are time pressure, lack of expertise and poor access to specialists. Aim To understand organisational factors and beliefs and behaviours among primary HCPs that may present barriers to identifying OA. Methods We employed a qualitative phenomenological methodology and undertook 20-45 min interviews with primary HCPs in West Midlands, UK. We used purposive and snowball sampling to include general practitioners (GPs) and practice nurses with a range of experience, from urban and rural settings. Interviews were recorded digitally and transcribed professionally for analysis. Data were coded by hand, and thematic analysis was undertaken and determined theoretically until themes were saturated. Results Eleven HCPs participated (eight GPs, three nurses). Four themes were identified that were considered to impact on identification of OA: (1) training and experience, (2) perceptions and beliefs, (3) systems constraints, and (4) variation in individual practice. OA-specific education had been inadequate at every stage of training and practice, and clinical exposure to OA had been generally limited. OA-specific beliefs varied, as did clinical behaviour with working-Age individuals with asthma. There was a focus on diagnosis and treatment rather than attributing causation. Identified issues regarding organisation of asthma care were time constraints, lack of continuity, referral pressure, use of guidelines and templates, and external targets. Conclusion Organisation and delivery of primary asthma care, negative OA-related beliefs, lack of formal education, and exposure to OA may all currently inhibit its identification.",2052-4439,-1,embase,1029,,,,109

Methods The GBD 2016 study estimated the burden in terms of deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) arising from the effects of occupational risk factors (carcinogens; asthmagens; particulate matter, gases and fumes (PMGF); secondhand smoke (SHS); noise; ergonomic risk factors for low back pain; risk factors for injury). A population attributable fraction (PAF) approach was used for most risk factors. Results In 2016, globally, an estimated 1.53 (95% uncertainty interval 1.39-1.68) million deaths and 76.1 (66.3-86.3) million DALYs were attributable to the included occupational risk factors, accounting for 2.8% of deaths and 3.2% of DALYs from all causes. Most deaths were attributable to PMGF, carcinogens (particularly asbestos), injury risk factors and SHS. Most DALYs were attributable to injury risk factors and ergonomic exposures. Men and persons 55 years or older were most affected. PAFs ranged from 26.8% for low back pain from ergonomic risk factors and 19.6% for hearing loss from noise to 3.4% for carcinogens. DALYs per capita were highest in Oceania, Southeast Asia and Central sub-Saharan Africa. On a per capita basis, between 1990 and 2016 there was an overall decrease of about 31% in deaths and 25% in DALYs.

For a start, the costs of prevention have to be paid in the present, while its benefits lie in the distant future. And the benefits are not tangible-when prevention succeeds, nothing happens. Taking such a political risk when there are few obvious rewards requires conviction and considerable vision."" [Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations (1)] The objective of epidemiologic investigations is to estimate the distribution and determinants of disease in populations, with the ultimate goal of disease prevention. Use of biomarkers in occupational epidemiology requires a multidisciplinary approach in which molecular genetics, cell biology, toxicology, biochemistry, statistics, and bioethics are incorporated into a traditional research framework. Recently, both genetic and epigenetic abnormalities have been detected in lesions in people clinically free of disease, and these abnormalities could be used in assessing the risks to and monitoring of the health of working populations. Paul A Schulte, in this issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Work, Environment & Health (2), elegantly discusses the implications of using genetic biomarkers in occupational epidemiology and practice. As he puts it, ""... sequencing of the human genome is the greatest opportunity for epidemiology since John Snow discovered the Broad Street Pump [p 76]"". Can we seize this opportunity? Biomarker use in monitoring exposure in a work environment was pioneered in the 1970s, first with respect to metals and organic solvents, then gradually expanding to a larger, more varied spectrum of exposures. This use expanded with the availability of techniques to measure effects at the molecular level, for instance, structural chromosome and gene damage, gene variation, and gene products in cells and body fluids (3). Use of these biomarkers improved our ability to understand causality by allowing more direct and more accurate measurement of exposure and outcome. The aim of occupational epidemiology is to study the causal relations between exposure to exogenous agents and the development of clinical disease. The mechanisms by which exposures lead to disease are still, however, often unknown. Direct observation of a relationship between disease and exposure was considerably easier when exposure levels were high, such as in the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. With changing environments and decreasing exposure levels, we need to evaluate subtler exposures and smaller risks. It has also been suggested that biomarker use also enhances quantitative risk assessment, by providing more accurate data for establishing dose-response relationships and measuring exposure and by facilitating the extrapolation of results from experimental animals to human populations. Individual susceptibility to a particular exposure can also theoretically be mapped genetically. Such studies have progressed quickly because of the rapid advances that occurred in relation to methods for molecular genetics in the 1980s and 1990s. Information about the distribution of ""preclinical"" lesions or markers of susceptibility has also contributed to the characterization of high-risk populations (4). The early detection of disease in occupational settings remains a priority for occupational medicine. The detection of early warning signs, at preclinical stages, can be facilitated by a variety of genetic and epigenetic approaches that allow the identification of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) alterations that can be detected with robust, validated assays. The most successful approaches include microsatellite analysis for the diagnosis of bladder cancer from urine samples and oral cancer from saliva. Promotor hypermethylation is a promising method that can be used to detect various types of cancer. Its particular attraction is that cancers can be detected by a simple analysis of serum or plasma DNA. The finding that aberrant methylation can be detected in epithelium of the upper aerodigestive tract from cancer-free heavy smokers (5) suggests that aberrant methylation is an ideal biomarker for assessing lung cancer risk and for monitoring in chemoprevention trials. Moreover, it has been shown in vitro that methylation can be reversed by demethylating agents and thereby result in gene re-expression. The role of polymorphic genes in the metabolism of xenobiotics has been the subject of extensive research during the past 30 years. Of primary concern in occupational and environmental studies are genes that have multiple alleles, sometimes referred to as ""metabolic polymorphisms"". They generally do not themselves present a risk, but do so only in combination with an exposure. Helmut Bartsch and his colleagues (6) summarized the results of studies on the relationship between several cytochrome P450 (CYP) genotypes and tobacco-related cancers in the upper aerodigestive tract, urinary tract, and breast. They reported that certain CYP variants were associated with increased risks of cancers of the lung, head, and neck in smokers. Alcohol is also a risk factor for head and neck cancers. The mechanism by which ethanol acts is, however, unclear. It may act by forming acetaldehyde, as the enzymes involved in acetaldehyde production are polymorphic and, therefore, result in between-person variation in ethanol metabolism. If this is the mechanism of ethanol-induced cancer risk, the effect of alcohol would be greater among persons who metabolize rapidly. The potential relationship between exposure to acetaldehyde and head and neck cancer would appear to be a good subject for studies of ""Mendelian randomization"", using genetics to test hypotheses about nongentic exposures (7). Mendelian randomization studies must meet the following preconditions if they are not to be flawed: the gene should not have other functions that influence the risk (pleiotropy), it should not influence behavior (drinking), and there should be no linkage disequilibrium with other genes that may influence the disease (8). Unlike most environmental exposures, which can be altered if proved to cause disease, inherited gene variants cannot be changed and can be passed on to subsequent generations. Given the number of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes and the wide variation in their inducibility and expression, it is probably too simplistic to consider examining one gene at a time in relation to cancer risk. Future studies should consider the roles of other genes in the pathways, and several genes should be examined at the same time in relation to disease risk. Techniques that provide simultaneous assessment of tens to hundreds of genetic variants in large numbers of samples will soon become available. It is, however, unrealistic to anticipate the incorporation of a large number of genes into current studies until the appropriate statistical methods are available. Researchers should also be concerned about the use and misuse of genetic information. Proper informed consent and confidentiality for study participants, as well as careful evaluation of subgroups of patients and gene-environment interactions, are imperative. In order to design a successful disease prevention program, we should ideally understand the natural history of the disease. Use of molecular markers in toxicology and epidemiology holds promise for elucidating the mechanisms of disease development and progression. Many of the factors in gene-environment interactions are modifiable and would provide a good starting point for primary prevention. It appears inevitable that various genetic polymorphisms will be identified at an increasing pace. Whether the identification will improve our ability to control occupational diseases is unclear. The number of genes that contribute to susceptibility to many diseases is likely to be large, and the effects of each gene on an allele will be weak. For example, if there are a dozen or more genes that contribute to myocardial infarct or to lung cancer, attempting to identify susceptible subgroups for public health intervention would be too complex to be of practical value. Thus, for myocardial infarct and lung cancer, and for most other chronic diseases, it is likely that more persons will benefit from modifications in their life-style or environmental factors than from knowledge about their genotypes. If scientists conduct a comprehensive search for the genetic basis of every health outcome and ignore environmental exposures and attributable risks, we are likely to miss opportunities to prevent disease. Undoubtedly, overoptimistic expectations about the ability of genomics research to solve chronic disease problems emerged in the period of excitement that followed the sequencing of the human genome. This overoptimisim stemmed in part from a lack of understanding of the complexity of disease causation and in part from a tendency of some scientists to overemphasize the immediate medical importance of their work to the media and granting agencies.",0355-3140 1795-990X,-1,openalex,1576,,,,112

For each case of lung cancer the probability that it was caused (probability of causation (PC)) by coal tar pitch volatiles was expressed as an increasing function of cumulative exposure to benzo-a-pyrene-years. This was assessed from several exposure-response models fitted to data from a large epidemiological study of aluminum production workers. For some models, PC depended also on the smoking habit of the cancer patient. Estimation of relative risk by exposure group indicated that over 50% of lung cancers were attributable to coal tar pitch volatiles (PC > 50%) at exposures above 100 micrograms/m3-years benzo(a)pyrene. A linear relative risk model indicated that 50% PC was first achieved at 342.2 micrograms/m3-years benzo(a)pyrene, or 190.1 micrograms/m3-years benzo(a)pyrene according to the upper 95% confidence limit for risk increment. Corresponding figures for a power curve model were 210.3 and 45.9.

If risks due to coal tar pitch volatiles and smoking multiply, PC does not depend on the amount smoked. If the two risks are additive, however, PC depends on the amount smoked according to a formula, with the figures mentioned applying to an average smoking history (24.4 pack-years). Because of its simplicity and because it falls within the range of criteria based on several more sophisticated approaches, we prefer the criterion of 100 micrograms/m3-years, based on the relative risks by exposure group. However, the compensation board of the Canadian province of Quebec, on consideration of these alternatives, has proposed as a criterion that the upper 95% confidence limit of PC for the patient be at least 50%, assuming an additive relative risk model and allowing for their smoking habit.",1351-0711,-1,"pubmed, embase","1434, 1227",,,,114

As part of an effort to estimate the occupational cancer burden in Canada, we present an approach that uses detailed exposure assessment data and probabilities to calculate a combined AF for nine lung carcinogens. Methods CAREX Canada estimates of exposure prevalence and level for five major lung carcinogens (silica, diesel, PAHs, nickel, and chromium) and prevalence alone for four exposure circumstances (welding, painting, iron and steel foundries, and rubber production) were merged to identify areas of overlap by detailed industry (328 groups) and occupation (520 groups). Exposure circumstances were removed from the assessments of relevant individual carcinogens to prevent double-counting. Exposure overlap was treated probabilistically, and where co-exposure occurred, the highest RR was assigned. Results There were 3.8 million Canadians alive in 2011 who were ever exposed to at least one of the nine occupational lung carcinogens during our risk exposure period of 1961–2000. Of these, 87% had been exposed to one carcinogen, and 13% to two; exposure to more three or more carcinogens was relatively uncommon (<1%). Individually, the highest lung cancer burdens are attributed to asbestos (1904 cancers), silica (573 cancers) and diesel (562 cancers). From the nine carcinogens combined, we estimate that each year 1510 new cases of lung cancer (AF = 6.4%) in Canada are attributable to occupational exposure. Conclusions Our combined occupational lung cancer burden estimate is conservative, as we did not account for synergy between exposures, and did not include asbestos-related lung cancers, which were estimated using a different methodology. Much of this work was enabled by the detailed CAREX Canada exposure assessment, but we remain limited by the lack of detailed historical exposure assessment for asbestos.",,abstract_added,openalex,1613,,,,115

196,1630,David Coggon,2021,Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health,10.5271/sjweh.4007,Estimating population burdens of occupational disease,83-85,48,2,"Knowing the public health impact of occupational hazards is important for prioritization of preventive and mitigating measures and in monitoring how well they succeed. Information is needed on attributable morbidity and mortality, both globally and by national/regional jurisdiction. The best method of estimating population burdens will vary according to the nature of the hazard. One important consideration is whether health effects can be ascribed to work with confidence in the individual. Such attribution is straightforward where a disease occurs only as a consequence of occupational exposure (eg, coal workers’ pneumoconiosis, byssinosis). Alternatively, a link to occupation can sometimes be established through clinical investigation. For example, allergic contact dermatitis may confidently be attributed to work where it is associated with demonstrable sensitization to an agent encountered only in the workplace; and the role of work in an acute injury or poisoning may be clear from its circumstances and timing. Even where a disorder is not occupational in origin, it may be made worse by exposures in the workplace to an extent that can be determined in the individual case. For example, exacerbation of pre-existing asthma by occupational inhalation of irritants may be apparent from serial measurements of lung function when an employee is at, and away from, work. In such circumstances, public health burden can be estimated by aggregating data on individual cases, either across the population as a whole, or in a representative subsample. Possible sources of information include routine surveillance schemes such as the Health and Occupation Research (THOR) Network (1), data on claims for industrial injuries compensation (provided they are sufficiently accurate and complete), and ad hoc surveys in representative samples of the population. Where a disease has material fatality (eg, silicosis), counts of deaths may provide a good measure of attributable mortality. More commonly, occupational disorders are not specific to work, and there is no reliable way of determining occupational contribution in the individual case. The hazard may increase the probability and/or the average severity of a disease. For example, asbestos makes development of lung cancer more likely, while coal mine dust causes chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) through incremental loss of lung function. Either way, the need is to determine how much morbidity or mortality would be eliminated across the population, if the relevant occupational exposure were removed. To this end, epidemiological data comparing health outcomes in people according to their exposure must be combined with information on the prevalence and distribution of exposure in the population for which an estimate is sought. This is the approach underpinning the WHO/ILO analysis that is reported in Pega et al’s paper (2). Estimates of relative risk for paired combinations of occupational risk factor and disease were collated with data on the population prevalence of exposure to calculate population attributable fractions (PAF) (3), which then were multiplied by estimates of the total population impact of the disease (in terms of deaths and disability-adjusted life-years) to derive burdens attributable to occupation (2). The analysis was necessarily restricted to combinations of risk factor and disease for which there was judged to be adequate evidence, but it also has other important limitations, not all of which are acknowledged and discussed. Some of the assumed hazards are questionable. For example, occupational exposure to formaldehyde is estimated to account for some 350–400 deaths per year from leukemia. Although the International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified formaldehyde as a human carcinogen (4), that decision was controversial, and the systematic review and meta-analysis from which the relative risk was derived concluded that “on balance, these data do not provide consistent support for a relationship between formaldehyde exposure and leukemia risk” (5). Similarly, doubts have been cast on the assumed hazard of ischemic heart disease from long working hours, at least among people of higher socioeconomic status (6). A second problem lies in the ambiguous specification of some risk factors. The analysis attributes large numbers of deaths from COPD to occupational exposure to “particulate matter, gases and fumes” (2). It is unclear, however, what exactly is implied by that term. The many and varied particulates, gases and fumes that people encounter through their work differ widely in their toxicity. If the mix of such pollutants differed between the studies that were used to estimate the prevalence of exposure, and those used to estimate relative risk, then major bias is possible. Even where risk factors are specified more precisely (eg, sulfuric acid), there are challenging complexities in the characterization and classification of exposure. Impacts at an individual level, whether on risk of disease or its severity, can vary enormously according to the timing, duration and intensity of exposures. An earlier report suggests that for many occupational carcinogens, exposures were classed to three levels (background/low/high) (7). However, within such broad categories, there may be substantial heterogeneity of risk. In the WHO/ILO analysis, many of the risk estimates for occupational carcinogens come from industrial cohort studies, which have tended to focus on working populations known or expected to have relatively high intensity and duration of exposure (making any risks more readily detectable). In contrast, data on the prevalence of exposure derive from studies that aimed to ascertain the full extent of exposure in the population, even if only at a modest level. Within a broad exposure category, a meta-estimate of risk from published cohort studies may not be applicable to the distribution of exposures within that category in the general population, and such incompatibility could in some cases cause population burden to be seriously overestimated. Another challenge when extrapolating risk estimates from samples to populations is the potential for effect modification. The burden of back and neck pain was assessed in relation to “occupational exposure to ergonomic factors” (2), defined as “proportion of the population who are exposed to ergonomic risk factors for low back pain at work or through their occupation” (3). However, it is unclear how well the calculation allowed for major variation between countries in the individual risk of musculoskeletal pain and disability from specified occupational activities (8, 9). One way round these problems is to estimate population burden more directly, using the same study to provide information both on the distribution of exposure in the population and the effects of that exposure. For example, a national analysis of mortality by occupation has been used to estimate excess deaths from COPD among coal miners in England and Wales (10). While such analyses have other important limitations (for example, mortality as recorded on death certificates is an imperfect marker for disease, and full account cannot be taken of changes in occupation over a lifetime), the risk estimates that they generate are an average for exposure as it occurs in the population as a whole. In this respect, provided the ascertainment of exposure is reasonably sensitive (specificity is less critical), estimates of population burden will be less prone to bias. Given the many sources of uncertainty in the WHO/ILO analysis, only some of which have been highlighted here, it is surprising that such tight 95% uncertainty ranges are reported. For example, the uncertainty in thousands of deaths globally in 2017 from occupational exposure to formaldehyde is reported as 1 to 1, and that for lung cancer from occupational exposure to diesel exhaust as 16 to 20 (3). This is a concern because findings published under the auspices of authoritative international bodies such as WHO and ILO are liable to be accepted by many without question. As occupational health researchers and practitioners, we are naturally disposed to champion the importance of health protection in the workplace, but that enthusiasm should not compromise scientific rigor. Findings that appear to support our case must be scrutinized with the same care as those that call it into question. When estimating population burdens of disease from occupational hazards, we should aim if possible to triangulate between different analytical approaches and sources of data, carefully considering and acknowledging sources of uncertainty. The potential for error will often be greatest for exposures that are relatively prevalent in the working population (eg, long working hours), for which small differences in excess relative risk can translate into substantial differences in estimated burdens of disease at population level.

We report a case of a 47-year old female incidentally found with this condition. CASE PRESENTATION: The patient, a non-smoker with a history of asthma, presented with difficulty breathing. She was on inhaled bronchodilators for her asthma which was not well-controlled. No history of fevers, chronic cough, hemoptysis, weight loss or environmental or occupational exposures was present. Examination was unremarkable. Lungs were clear to auscultation. Cardiac examination was normal. Chest x-ray revealed two circumscribed masses in her right upper lobe (Image 1). A Computerized Tomogram(CT)-guided needle biopsy was planned. However, on CT chest, the masses appeared to have a fluid attenuation and were peripherally distributed with localized hyperlucency distal to the mass (Image 2). The mass-like lesions represented the obstructed bronchus, dilated due to mucus impaction, with localized area of hyperinflation manifest as increased lucency distal to the lesion.Bronchial atresia (BA) was diagnosed based upon these characteristic CT findings. The patient was treated with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids, with improvement in her asthma symptoms. On follow-up 6 months later, the patient is doing well without any sequelae. DISCUSSION: BA, a rare congenital tracheobronchial anomaly, occurs predominantly in males. A vascular insult during embryogenesis has been implicated in its causation. It is characterized by a focal narrowing of a sub-segmental, segmental or lobar bronchus, associated with mucocele formation due to mucus impaction, and hyperinflation of the distal segment of lung. The alveoli supplied by the obstructed bronchi are ventilated vi a collateral airways, resulting in air-trapping and localized hyperinflation.Most patients are asymptomatic with about 30% experiencing recurrent respiratory infections, cough, dyspnea or haemoptysis. At present, BA is usually diagnosed by CT. Bronchoscopy may be non-diagnostic but maybe required in cases where similar findings on CT can be found, such as lung cancer or bronchial adenoma.Tissue biopsy is not essential for diagnosis, if characteristic CT features are present. Management is conservative unless there is a superimposed infection of the mucocele. Surgical excision is generally reserved for patients with recurrent infections.

The long term success of future National Screening Programme as an early diagnosis tool may be dependent upon identifying populations at sufficient risk of developing the disease such that the benefit:harm ratio of the intervention can be maximised. Risk prediction models can play an important role in risk stratification by providing an estimate of individual's risk of developing a disease at a future time, but require validation in independent populations before they can be successfully generalised. Within the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP), we have developed a risk prediction model for estimating individual's 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer. The model was based on five epidemiological risk factors namely smoking duration, prior diagnosis of pneumonia, family history of lung cancer, occupational exposure to asbestos and prior diagnosis of other cancer. We present here an independent validation and clinical utility of the model using data from two case-control studies and a cohort population from Europe and North America. Method: The 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer was estimated for subjects in the Harvard and European Early Lung Cancer (EUELC) case-control and LLP prospective cohort studies. The model's performance was assessed through its predictive accuracy (discrimination and calibration) and clinical utility. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUC) measures the model's discriminatory power while calibration was assessed by comparing the observed and the expected lung cancer cases in the cohort population. The clinical relevance of the model was examined using the decision and relative utility curves. Results: There was an evidence of good discriminations in Harvard (AUC = 0.76) and LLP cohort (c-index = 0.77, 0.82) with no significant difference in discrimination by age, gender and smoking status. In general, the model calibration indicated an underestimation of absolute risk; this showed improvement with high absolute risks.

The primary methodology used involved estimating the population attributable fraction by estimating exposure prevalence and identifying appropriate relative risks. Some other estimation approaches were also used. Results The key results of the work will be presented and discussed.

The assertion that asbestosis must be present in order to attribute a lung cancer to asbestos exposure does not meet accepted standards for establishing causation. In addition, some evidence has been incorrectly cited in support of this position. This discussion can benefit from clearer definitions of asbestosis, a more thorough evaluation of the available scientific information, and a proper context for determining causation. This review of the available evidence indicates that lung cancers can occur as a result of asbestos exposure, in the absence of clinical or histologic asbestosis.

A claimant does not have to prove fault to receive compensation under the Act, only causation. The 1965 Act has been fundamental in shaping litigation involving the nuclear industry in the UK. Civil law cases brought under the Act will be heard before a single judge (with no jury or technical assessor) who must present his or her decision in a reasoned judgment. This process leads to a considerable volume of expert evidence being presented to the court and extensive cross-examination of witnesses. The expense and uncertain outcome of cases involving claims by nuclear workers that occupational exposure to radiation had caused the development of cancer has led to employers and trade unions setting up the voluntary Compensation Scheme for Radiation-linked Diseases as an alternative to litigation. This Scheme has worked well and is held up as a model of alternative dispute resolution. However, a few cases concerning personal injury or damage to property have come before the courts when the defendant nuclear operator considered that the claims were technically unjustified and where settlement was not a policy option. As anticipated, these cases were lengthy, complex, and expensive. The radiation doses assessed to have been received by the individuals who were the subject of claims, whether workers or members of the public, have been crucial to the outcome.

In fact, age standardized incidence rates have increased sharply over recent decades, while ability to treat and cure most cancers has not materially improved. Furthermore, the NCI has minimized evidence for increasing cancer rates which are largely attributed to smoking and to diet. In so doing, NCI trivializes the importance of occupational carcinogens as non-smoking-attributable causes of lung and other cancers, and ignores the tenuous and inconsistent evidence for the causal role of diet per se and also the important role of carcinogenic dietary contaminants. Reflecting this near exclusionary blame-the-victim theory of cancer causation, with support from the American Cancer Society and industry, the NCI discounts the role of avoidable involuntary exposures to industrial carcinogens in air, water, food, the home, and the workplace. The NCI has also failed to provide scientific guidance to Congress and regulatory agencies on fundamental principles of carcinogenesis and epidemiology, and on the critical need to reduce avoidable exposures to environmental and occupational carcinogens. Contrary to NCI, analysis of their $2 billion budget reveals very limited allocations for research on primary cancer prevention, and for occupational cancer which receives only $19 million annually, 1% of NCI's total budget. Problems of professional mindsets in NCI leadership--fixation on diagnosis, treatment, and basic research (much of questionable relevance) and the neglect of cancer prevention--are exemplified by the composition of the Executive President's Cancer Panel and the National Cancer Advisory Board. Contrary to the explicit mandate of the National Cancer Act, the Board is virtually devoid of recognized authorities in occupational and environmental carcinogenesis. These problems are further compounded by institutionalized conflicts of interest reflected in the composition of past Cancer Panels, and of the current Board of Overseers of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, NCI's prototype comprehensive cancer center, with their closely interlocking financial interests with the cancer drug and other industries. Comprehensive reforms of NCI policies and priorities are overdue.

A prospective, nationwide study was undertaken to develop and validate a risk model for febrile neutropenia (FN) in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. Methods: More than 2,300 patients with cancers of the breast, lung, colon and ovary or lymphoma initiating a new regimen have been prospectively registered at 137 randomly selected sites. Data on at least 1 cycle of chemotherapy are available on 2,106. A standard regimen has been defined in 1,464 patients permitting an estimation of planned dose intensity (PDI). A logistic regression model for cycle 1 FN in those with known PDI was developed and test performance characteristics estimated. Results: Of 222 patients experiencing FN events, 125 (56%) did so in cycle 1 with prophylactic growth factors reported in only 3.5%. Major independent clinical factors in the risk model include: anthracycline chemotherapy (OR=7.80;P=.001); immune disorders (OR=5.14;P=.014); pretreatment neutropenia (OR=4.00;P<.001); elevated bilirubin (OR=3.73;P=.009); ECOG PS ≥2 (OR=2.84;P=.010); stage 1–2 disease (OR=2.66;P=.009); pretreatment lymphopenia (OR=2.51;P=.001); elevated alkaline phosphatase (OR=2.15; P=.012); pretreatment thrombocytopenia (OR=1.5;P=.024), and anemia (OR=1.43;P=.069).

The overall importance of occupational agents as a cause of lung cancer has been a controversial subject since the 1970s. A federal report, released in the late 1970s, projected a surprisingly high burden of occupational lung cancer; for asbestos and four other agents, from 61,000 to 98,000 cases annually were attributed to these agents alone. Many estimates followed, some much more conservative. For example, Doll and Peto estimated that 15% of lung cancer in men and 5% in women could be attributed to occupational exposures. A number of population-based case-control studies also provide relevant estimates. In a recent literature review, Vineis and Simonato cited attributable risk estimates for occupation and lung cancer that ranged from 4% to 40%; for asbestos alone, the estimates ranged from 1% to 5%. These estimates would be expected to vary across locations and over time. Nevertheless, these recent estimates indicate that occupation remains an important cause of lung cancer. Approaches to Prevention. Prevention of lung cancer mortality among workers exposed to agents or industrial processes that cause lung cancer may involve several strategies, including eliminating or reducing exposures, smoking cessation, screening, and chemo-prevention. For example, changes in industrial processes that have eliminated or reduced exposures to chloromethyl ethers and nickel compounds have provided evidence of reduced risk of lung cancer following these changes. Although occupational exposures are important causes of lung cancer, cigarette smoking is the most important preventable cause of lung cancer. For adults, the work site offers an important location to target smoking cessation efforts. In fact, the work site may be the only place to reach many smokers. As many as 70% of smokers participating in a work site program reported that they would not seek out other programs for smoking cessation. Furthermore, these programs may be as effective as other smoking cessation programs, with abstinence approaching 30%. By creating a supportive social environment, policies restricting smoking in the workplace may also assist smokers trying to quit. Screening of workers at high risk of lung cancer, with periodic chest radiography and sputum cytology, offers potential methods for early detection that may improve prognosis. However, the failure of those procedures to improve outcome from lung cancer among high-risk smokers makes screening of workers of doubtful value. Both epidemiologic and experimental evidence suggest that dietary factors may modify the risk of lung cancer. To date, attention has been focused on vitamin A and carotenoids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",0272-5231,manual_review,"pubmed, embase","1458, 1252",,,,136

Care Med,,Giant cell interstitial pneumonia without any hard metal or cobalt exposure,,189,,"Introduction Giant cell interstitial pneumonia (GIP), a rare form of pneumoconiosis causing pulmonary fibrosis, is attributed to exposure to metal compounds such as cobalt or tungsten carbide. GIP is known to occur in patients with exposure to the hard metal industry or diamond tooling, suggesting causation. However, there are cases, including this one, in which no hard metal or cobalt exposure is identified. Case Report A 45 year old African American male with a past medical history significant for hypertension, hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus presented with a dry cough, 20 pound weight loss, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion and dyspnea with exertion that developed over several months. He was treated with multiple courses of antibiotics without improvement. He was employed as a high school gym teacher and a landscaper in Georgia. Previously, he worked at a retail distribution center loading trucks. He denied exposure to hard metals, cobalt, silica, coal dust, asbestos, pet birds or any chemicals. He was a lifetime nonsmoker and denied use of illicit drugs. On examination, his lungs were clear to auscultation and no clubbing was noted. Serologic testing was negative for a hypersensitivity pneumonitis panel, Aspergillus antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus antibodies, anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, antinuclear antibodies, and antiribonucleoprotein antibodies. Pulmonary function tests showed normal spirometry, total lung capacity and diffusing capacity. An echocardiogram was remarkable for an ejection fraction of 55-60% with stage I diastolic dysfunction. Cultures from a bronchoscopy with broncheoalveolar lavage were negative for mycobacteria and grew mixed flora. A contrasted chest computed tomography revealed bilateral, lower lobe predominant, patchy ground glass, consolidations and subpleural honeycombing (Figure 1) without noted mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. A biopsy from video-assisted thoracoscopy surgery was consistent with giant cell pneumonitis, in addition to non-caseating granulomata, organizing pneumonia, anthracosis and fibrosis. He was treated with prednisone 50 mg daily and his symptoms improved. Discussion We present a unique case of GIP in a patient without any known exposures to hard metals or cobalt that improved with steroid treatment. Although there were granulomata on the biopsy, the predominant abnormality on biopsy was giant cells, which would not be consistent with sarcoidosis. This case adds to the existing evidence that steroids may be beneficial in this rare disease and that exposure to hard metals or cobalt may not be necessary for GIP disease occurrence.

These supplement the present somewhat simplistic ones for 'sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity' advocated by the International Agency for Research against Cancer in their monograph series. A frequent cause of confounding, not always appreciated, is the limited choice of a reference population for the statistical analyses. The study population is often an industrial one with marked regional and urban biases, especially for some of the cancers under scrutiny: these biases can influence markedly the resultant Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR) calculated, and thus lead to misleading conclusions. The British Rubber Manufacturers' Mortality Study, 1946-1980, provided an opportunity to extract the data set of one of the 13 factories involved. Both local and national death rates were applied as a reference, and the use of the former substantially reduced the high SMRs previously recorded for lung and stomach cancers. This emphasized the need for further analyses when making other internal comparisons in order to accommodate more of the 'desiderata' listed. Ultimately causation can be inferred only after weighing up all the evidence, and must be based on a 'balance of probabilities'.",0003-4878,-1,"pubmed, embase","1464, 1261",,,,138

A systematic literature search was conducted to locate relevant papers in English, published up to June 2012, usingMedline and NIOSH-TIC2. Based on the current literature, the mechanisms of endotoxin-related COPD causation and lung cancerprotection appear to operate through differential effects of an inflammatory response to inhaled endotoxin. In particular, COPD riskand cancer prevention appear to both be driven by activation of cytokines, including TNF-α and IL-12, through inhaled endotoxin. Inaddition, genetic polymorphisms and both duration and level of exposure may be important determinants of disease. We recommendthat further research on the role of endotoxin and lung disease focus on understanding the effects of the duration or level of exposureto endotoxin necessary for development of COPD, and on determining the stage of tumor development most affected by endotoxins.

Broin was followed by our smokers’ class action lawsuit, Engle v R.J. Reynolds, filed in 1994. Dr Howard Engle was the pediatrician for our 9 children and, as a longtime addicted smoker, served as lead class representative. Both class actions received a great deal of media attention, raised public awareness of the dangers of secondhand smoke, and helped bring about much-needed smoking bans.The prevalent attitude in 1991, as reflected during Broin jury selection, was that secondhand cigarette smoke was a mere annoyance, not a health risk. Tobacco company lawyers argued during the Broin trial that secondhand smoke exposure in an airline cabin was the equivalent of “a few packets of Sweet ‘N Low in Lake Okeechobee.”Broin was settled after 4 months of trial in 1997 and, among various other classwide benefits, the settlement provided for the creation by the court of a $300 million nonprofit research foundation, the Flight Attendant Medical Research Institute (FAMRI). FAMRI works to fund research to prevent, treat, and cure the many diseases associated with tobacco smoke and is governed by a board consisting of a majority of flight attendants. FAMRI also works to ensure that health care professionals ask their patients about secondhand smoke exposure when taking a medical history.We are proud to have served FAMRI without compensation since its inception. FAMRI benefitted tremendously from the support and guidance of some of the key public health witnesses in our tobacco trials, including the late, former US Surgeon General Julius B. Richmond and the late, former American Medical Association president Ron Davis. FAMRI created and supports several prestigious centers of excellence, including the American Academy of Pediatrics Julius B. Richmond Center of Excellence, which protects infants and children from secondhand tobacco smoke. Unfortunately, children are still trapped in smoke-filled cars and homes and need our protection. FAMRI-funded science at the Richmond Center has educated the public and resulted in more and broader smoking bans, including bans in multiunit housing. FAMRI continues to fund science to improve the detection and measurement of secondhand smoke, and through the Richmond Center, FAMRI educates parents and assists them and caregivers with smoking cessation.Twenty-five years after we filed Broin, FAMRI has funded over 4000 peer-reviewed publications with thousands of related presentations and abstracts. A few years ago, our independent peer reviewers (American Institute of Biological Sciences) measured FAMRI’s productivity and impact in the scientific community. We were gratified to learn that FAMRI’s adjusted h-index was 5.365, second only to Harvard among top-ranked university academic science departments.The Broin settlement also required the tobacco companies to support a smoking ban on international flights. Back in 1991, there were few (if any) laws establishing smoke-free workplaces; today, nearly all workplaces are smoke-free: a key factor in the reduction of smoking rates.Back in 1991 when we filed Broin, Big Tobacco was unbeatable. Patty Young, a flight attendant member of our board, tried to find a lawyer for her case and met with major law firms throughout the United States, including Ralph Nader’s Public Citizen Group. None would agree to represent her against tobacco companies. We were ridiculed by colleagues and family for taking on such expensive and all-consuming litigation that subsumed our lives and our law firm and placed us in debt, with essentially no chance of success. We had no dream team: just us, 2 workaholics. Stanley, the trial lawyer, tried both class actions, including Engle, the 2-year trial and the longest civil trial in history. Susan, the legal and appellate lawyer, designed the cases as class actions rather than individual cases and navigated them through complex pleadings, endless motion practice produced by an army of tobacco lawyers, and numerous appeals through the US Supreme Court.A turning point in the litigation and in public awareness generally came in the fall of 1993 when Stanley deposed Big Tobacco’s chief executive officers (CEOs). The CEOs testified under oath that nicotine is not addictive and smoking does not cause lung cancer or any other disease. Stanley confronted and questioned them about internal tobacco documents that we obtained through discovery, revealing the tobacco industry’s ongoing conspiracy to manipulate science and mislead smokers and the public. The depositions were covered by the New York Times in a lead story on December 6, 1993, which caught the attention of Congressman Henry Waxman, who subpoenaed the CEOs to appear before Congress the following April. During that televised congressional hearing, the CEOs were asked the same questions and gave the same answers on addiction and disease: their “party line” on smoking and health issues. The states’ attorneys general Medicaid recoupment actions soon followed.The landscape on smoking and health litigation dramatically changed as a result of our class actions. The 2-year Engle trial resulted in the largest punitive damages verdict in history: $145 billion. Although that portion of the verdict was vacated, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed compensatory damage awards and held that the Engle jury’s findings of causation of over 20 diseases and the multiple liability findings were binding before subsequent juries in individual smokers’ cases in Florida. Engle established fraudulent concealment committed by tobacco through the promotion of low-tar and light cigarettes, which were designed by the industry to intercept health-conscious smokers on their path to quitting. Florida remains the only state in the country where smokers regularly win their lawsuits because of the Engle findings.",0031-4005 1098-4275,-1,openalex,1712,,,,140

Controls were randomly selected from cancers not known to be associated with the effects of tobacco, matched by sex and age (65years). Usual occupation and/or workplace stated at interview were used as an indicator of occupational exposure. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using unconditional logistic regression and attributable fraction (AF) by Miettinen's formula, adjusted for smoking pack years, HIV status and domestic fuel type use. RESULTS: The mean age of cases and controls was 56.0 and 57.1 respectively. Among men the adjusted OR for lung cancer was 3.0 (95% CI 1.4-6.4) in miners and 1.7 (95% CI 1.3-3.2) in those working in transport occupations. In women working as domestic worker (maids, child minders etc) the adjusted OR was 7.3 (95% CI 1.7-11.3) whereas working in the food & beverage industry, the adjusted OR was 4.9 (95% CI 1.4-26.8). Occupation/workplace resulted in an AF of 14% in men and 26% in women. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational risk factors for lung cancer in South Africa are gender-specific, having more impact in women than in men. Further studies are needed to assess possible specific exposures in the mining and transport industries for men, and food industry and private homes for women.",0300-5771,-1,embase,"1079, 1092, 1098",,,,141

However, the long term success of future National Screening Programmes as early diagnosis tools will be dependent upon identifying populations at sufficient risk of developing the disease. The current lung cancer risk models include those of; Bach, Spitz, NELSON, LLP and the PLCO. The Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) Risk Model estimates an individual's 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer. The model was based on five epidemiological risk factors: smoking duration, prior diagnosis of pneumonia, family history of lung cancer, occupational exposure to asbestos and prior diagnosis of other cancer. Validation of the LLP Risk Model has been undertaken in the Harvard and European Early Lung Cancer (EUELC) case-control and LLP prospective cohort studies. There was evidence of good discrimination in Harvard (AUC= 0.76) and LLP cohorts (c-index= 0.77, 0.82), with no significant difference in discrimination by age, gender and smoking status. The LLP Risk model is used to select individuals from the UK Lung cancer CT screening trial (UKLS). The long term objective is to incorporate biomarkers based on susceptibility genes or acquired genetic and epigenetic changes into the risk models, to improve their level of discrimination. Early work on susceptibility genes has provided some evidence that the models may be improved, however currently the most promising are methylation and microRNA biomarkers in high risk individuals. Preliminary evidence points to the value of utilising a set of 6 methylation biomarkers as shown in the LLP case-control study of bronchial lavage specimens. Stratification of the results by cytology indicated that the best discriminatory algorithm is particularly useful for cytology negative subjects as there was a tremendous increase in sensitivity among this group of subjects (3% to 74%) with a moderate decrease in specificity (100% to 82%). The Sozzi team in Italy have demonstrated that miRNA expression profiling in plasma collected 1-2 y before the onset of disease, provided strong predictive, diagnostic, and prognostic signatures (AUC≥ 0.85) at the time of CT detection and in disease-free smokers enrolled in the screening trial.",1556-0864,-1,embase,1119,,,,142

Among the 13 OCs, the 3 leading risk factors for cancer burden were asbestos (71.8%), silica (15.4%), and diesel engine exhaust (5.6%).

Poor survival rates make lung cancer the most common cause of cancer death. Method: We have studied management and organization of lung cancer care in 20 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russian Federation, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We have compared outcomes of lung cancer care, measured by dividing incidence with prevalence using data from the GLOBOCAN 2002 database. We have also analyzed policies promoting and restricting patient access to the most appropriate treatment. Results: There are large variations between countries in terms of incidence and mortality and the outcome of lung cancer care. United Kingdom, Denmark, Poland, the Czech Republic, Ireland, Russia, Hungary and Norway perform below the average of countries in the study. There are several determinants of outcomes of lung cancer care, and the direct correlation and causation must be interpreted with caution. The countries with best outcome have a higher expenditure on health care, with the exception of UK, Ireland and Denmark standing out as having among the poorest outcomes in spite of overall health expenditures at the median. Lack of investments have also led to a serious shortage of radiation facilities in many countries. The organization of cancer care in many of the poorest performing countries is fragmented and treatment unevenly accessible to patients. Policies, procedures, budgeting systems and economic conditions delay market introduction and restrict patient access to modern lung cancer drugs (docetaxel, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, and vinorelbine). The uptake and use of these drugs (sales/ per lung cancer death) is below the European average in countries with poorer outcome. The same is true for the most recent drugs introduced, erlotinib and pemetrexed. Conclusions: The high burden of the lung cancer diseases urges for improvement of lung cancer care.

For some cancers, substantial progress in individual risk estimation has already been made. However, relatively few models have been developed to predict lung cancer risk beyond effects of age and smoking. This paper reviews published models for lung cancer risk prediction, discusses their potential contribution to clinical and research settings and suggests improvements to the risk modeling strategy for lung cancer. The sensitivity and specificity of existing cancer risk models is less than optimal. Improvement in individual risk prediction is important for selection of individuals for prevention or early detection interventions. In addition to smoking, factors related to occupational exposure, personal medical history and family history of cancer can add to the predictive power. A good risk prediction model is one that can identify a small fraction of the population in which a large proportion of the disease cases will occur. In the future, genetic and other biological markers are likely to be useful, although they will require rigorous evaluation.

Occupational investigators have assessed interaction primarily as a departure from an additive rather than from a multiplicative model of relative risks (or rate ratios). To determine whether smoking modifies the effect of occupational lung carcinogens, the literature was reviewed for the only four established occupational lung carcinogens for which there are data on smoking: radon daughters, asbestos, arsenic, and chloromethyl ethers. Where possible, departure was assessed from both an additive (synergism) and a multiplicative model (effect modification). Only nine studies were considered to have sufficient sample size and to provide sufficient information on tobacco use and occupational exposure to evaluate interaction. The existing data were contradictory for three of the agents studied: asbestos, radon daughters, and arsenic. Inconclusive or contradictory findings may result from small sample size or lack of comparability of the level of occupational or tobacco exposure. It is noteworthy that, for these four agents, whenever smoking did modify the effect of occupational exposure, the lung cancer rate ratio was greater for nonsmokers (compared to nonexposed nonsmokers) than smokers (compared to nonexposed smokers). However, with the exception of chloromethyl ethers, absolute lung cancer rates were higher for smokers than nonsmokers, regardless of occupational exposure.",0096-1736,title_duplicate,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1482, 1270, 1501",,,,149

It is for this reason that we chose as our job exposure matrix (JEM) the DOM-JEM that was developed specifically to be applied in studies of this kind.3Pira and Coggiola express concern that the DOM-JEM is unable to distinguish between ‘no’, ‘low’ and ‘high’ exposed jobs/subjects. Their reasoning comes from the fact that among the 2529 men in our study classified as non-exposed to crystalline silica, two subjects reported at interview having been diagnosed with silicosis.We believe that our method is sound. First, with a JEM approach in a population-based study (as this lung cancer case-control is) the JEM constructors would have to aim for a more specific than sensitive JEM3 in order to prevent serious misclassification of non-exposed individuals and consequent attenuation of risk estimates.4 By creating a very specific JEM, like DOM-JEM, only jobs with relatively high intensity and high prevalence of exposed individuals performing these jobs will be assigned (high) exposure. So for instance, within DOM-JEM the job titles shown in Table 1, coded using the five-digit International Standard Classification for Occupations (ISCO) 1968 codes,5 are assigned a ‘high’ exposure to crystalline silica. Table 1International Standard Classification for Occupations (ISCO) 1968 codesAlso, to take into account the small actual difference in silica exposures between the ‘no’ and ‘low’ categories we decided to use the intensity weights of 0, 1 and 4 when estimating cumulative years of silica exposure.Second, as stated in our paper, the DOM-JEM has been compared with other JEMs and individual expert assessments in previous international studies.6,7 Notably, in the study of Peters et al.,6 the odds ratio for the association between lung cancer and silica obtained by applying the DOM-JEM was 1.26, almost identical to those obtained using case-by-case expert assessment (1.26) and a population-specific JEM (1.24). Similar results were obtained for exposure to diesel motor exhaust, whereas for asbestos DOM-JEM showed more consistent results as compared with the other two methods.Third, it is of course possible on rare occasions for a worker performing a theoretically non-exposed job to be exposed (e.g. a schoolteacher exposed to asbestos from a ceiling), but any resultant occurrence of cases of silicosis in the ‘no’ exposure group does not intrinsically invalidate the JEM. This misclassification can only be addressed (if at all) when the exposure can be assigned at the individual level, but it requires a much more detailed job history. Assigning all schoolteachers an exposure to asbestos based on an anecdotal example would be wrong and would create an enormous amount of falsepositively assigned exposures resulting in risk estimates attenuated towards the null.Fourth, the two cases of silicosis that we classified as non-exposed maybe incorrect due to reporting or diagnosis error. In fact, silicosis was only reported at interview in our study. Also, silicosis diagnosis is far from straightforward; radiographic evaluation even by qualified and experienced chest radiographers8 has a poor sensitivity and, whereas specificity is very good, false-positives may occur.9In summary, we believe that the critique made by Pira and Coggiola of the DOM-JEM, based on a couple of (supposedly) misclassified subjects, without consideration of the whole study, is unfounded.DOM-JEM is a job-exposure matrix specifically developed for population-based studies, with only job-title information in the job histories and with the explicit philosophy of being rather more specific than sensitive in the assignment of exposures so as to avoid misclassification of non-exposed subjects as much as possible. The assigned levels are an informative relative ranking of ‘no’, ‘low’ and ‘high’ exposure and without calibration will have no absolute meaning on a ratio scale (e.g. mg/m3-years of silica exposure).Therefore, we stand by our conclusion that past occupational exposure to asbestos, silica and nickel-chromium, even at low levels, contributes substantially to the current lung cancer burden. Our estimates of population-attributable fractions of 18.1%, 5.7% and 7.0%, respectively, are necessarily imperfect but state-of-the-art and reasonable measures of the impact of these occupational carcinogens on lung cancer risk in this study population.2",0300-5771 1464-3685,-1,openalex,1660,,,,150

ProZES calculates this probability, the assigned share, for solid cancers and hematopoietic malignant diseases, in cases of exposures to low-LET radiation, and for lung cancer in cases of exposure to radon. User-specified inputs include birth year, sex, type of diagnosed cancer, age at diagnosis, radiation exposure history and characteristics, and smoking behaviour for lung cancer. Cancer risk models are an essential part of ProZES. Linking disease and exposure to radiation involves several methodological aspects, and assessment of uncertainties received particular attention. ProZES systematically uses the principle of multi-model inference. Models of radiation risk were either newly developed or critically re-evaluated for ProZES, including dedicated models for frequent types of cancer and, for less common diseases, models for groups of functionally similar cancer sites. The low-LET models originate mostly from the study of atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Risks predicted by these models are adjusted to be applicable to the population of Germany and to different time periods. Adjustment factors for low dose rates and for a reduced risk during the minimum latency time between exposure and cancer are also applied. The development of the methodology and software was initiated and supported by the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) taking up advice by the German Commission on Radiological Protection (SSK, Strahlenschutzkommission).

127,1497,Doll,1976,Revue d'epidemiologie et de sante publique,,The contribution of epidemiology to knowledge of cancer.,107-121,24,2,"Epidemiology has contributed to knowledge of cancer in five ways. First, it has demonstrated that all cancers that are at all common anywhere vary in incidence from place to place and from time to time. The amount of variation is large, sometimes several hundred fold, and no cancers are so uniformly common that they would affect as many as 1 per cent of people by 75 years of age, in the absence of other causes of death, in all countries. Studies of migrant groups and the changes that have occurred with time show that this variation is, in large part, due to environmental factors and that most cancers are, in principle, preventible. Secondly it has shown that the incidence of specific cancers can be correlated with the prevalence of factors in the environment that might be suspected of causing the disease. Recent correlations include those between oesophageal cancer in Iran and the consumption of certain locally produced foods, between colon cancer and the presence of certain groups of anaerobic bacteria in the faeces, and between liver cancer and the amount of aflatoxin in the diet. These correlations do not provide direct evidence of causation, but they do suggest ideas for investigation by other methods. Thirdly, epidemiology has provided means for testing hypotheses by relating the occurrence of particular types of cancer to the personal characteristics of individuals, either by studying the past experience of people with and without cancer, or by following up people whose exposure to suspected agents has been previously defined. In this way it has been possible to detect dozens of occupational hazards in industry, which is many more than have been detected by laboratory experiment. Fourthly, epidemiology has confirmed that an agent is a cause of cancer by monitoring the effects of intervention to reduce or prevent exposure. An example is provided by observation in British doctors, who have reduced their consumption of cigarettes to half the national average and have experienced a corresponding reduction in the risk of death from cancers of the lung.",0398-7620,manual_review,"pubmed, embase","1497, 1283",,,,152

METHODS: A prospective cohort study on diet, other lifestyle factors, job history, and cancer risk that started in 1986 in The Netherlands on 58,279 men, aged 55-69 years. Based on information about job history obtained from a self-administered questionnaire, case by case expert assessment was carried out to assign to each study subject a cumulative probability of occupational exposure for each carcinogenic exposure. For analysis, a case-cohort approach was used, in which the person-years at risk were estimated from a randomly selected subcohort (n = 1688). After 4.3 years of follow up, 524 lung cancer cases with complete job history were available. RESULTS: After adjustment for age, each of the other occupational exposures, and for smoking habits and intake of vitamin C, beta-carotene, and retinol, significant associations were found between risk of lung cancer and cumulative probability of occupational exposure to asbestos (relative risk (RR) highest/no exposure = 3.49, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.69 to 7.18, trend P &lt; 0.01 or paint dust (RR highest/no exposure = 2.48, 95% CI 0.88 to 6.97, trend P &lt; 0.01).

They are formed during incomplete combustion or pyrolysis of organic material such as coal, wood, petroleum products and waste. During each formation process, and consequently in air, water, soil and food, PAHs are always present as a, and never as individual compounds, in complex mixtures containing also other chemicals. In a workplace environment such as a coking plant, the evaluation of workers exposure to carcinogenic risk is very important. Currently, no national law provides safety limits for individual PAH; at the international level, ACGIH reference limit exist only for volatile products of tar and coal pitch, expressed TLV-TWA (0.2 mgÂ·m-3). In order to evaluate the carcinogenic activity of a mixture of PAHs, it is possible to follow two ways. Since benzo(a)pyrene (BaP) is the most widely studied compound from a toxicological point of view and it is the most frequently evaluated compound in several matrices, it is possible to estimate the carcinogenic activity of a mixture of PAHs according to its content of a reference compound such as BaP. WHO used this methodology in 1987 to estimate the risk of lung cancer associated with inhalation exposure to mixtures of PAHs. Another approach is based on toxic equivalency factors, conceptually analogous to those used for the evaluation of attributable risk to mixtures of dioxins. Once note the carcinogenic power of individual PAHs compared to that of a reference compound (eg, BaP), their contribution can be normalized using the Toxicity Equivalence Factors BaPeq (TEF). Considering the toxicological significance of this class of compounds, representative sampling of the environmental status were made in an iron ore steel plant, in order to assess the personal exposure of workers employed, using sampling and measurement devices, able to represent the average situation of the work shift. Moreover, both approaches were used to assess the carcinogenic activity of environmental samples.",,abstract_added,openalex,1746,,,,154

The quantity, Radiation Attributed Decrease of Survival (RADS), representing the cumulative decrease in the unknown survival curve at a certain attained age, due to the radiation exposure at an earlier age, forms the basis for this alternative approach. Results are provided for all solid cancer plus leukemia incidence RADS from estimated doses from theoretical radiation exposures accumulated during long-term missions to the Moon or Mars. For example, it is shown that a 1000-day Mars exploration mission with a hypothetical mission effective dose of 1.07 Sv at typical astronaut ages around 40 years old, will result in the probability of surviving free of all types of solid cancer and leukemia until retirement age (65 years) being reduced by 4.2% (95% CI 3.2; 5.3) for males and 5.8% (95% CI 4.8; 7.0) for females. RADS dose-responses are given, for the outcomes for incidence of all solid cancer, leukemia, lung and female breast cancer. Results showing how RADS varies with age at exposure, attained age and other factors are also presented. The advantages of this alternative approach, over currently applied methodologies for the long-term radiation protection of astronauts after mission exposures, are presented with example calculations applicable to European astronaut occupational HRA. Some tentative suggestions for new types of occupational risk limits for space missions are given while acknowledging that the setting of astronaut radiation-related risk limits will ultimately be decided by the Space Agencies. Suggestions are provided for further work which builds on and extends this new HRA approach, e.g., by eventually including non-cancer effects and detailed space dosimetry.",1432-2099,-1,pubmed,1306,,,,155

However, understanding the nature and scope of these exposures is difficult. This presentation considers what is known about such exposures in Australia and the burden of cancer arising from them. Methods: The most comprehensive information on occupational exposures in Australia comes from the Australian Workplace Exposure Study (AWES). This study focussed on carcinogens. In terms of burden, the most up to date information has been estimated as part of the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study, which includes a range of occupational carcinogens, most notably asbestos, silica and diesel engine exhaust. A population attributable fraction (PAF) approach was used. The PAFs were applied to estimates of the total number of deaths or Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) of a disorder to produce estimates of the number of deaths or the overall burden (in DALYs) arising from the exposures. Results: Available information from AWES suggests that about 40% of the Australian workforce are exposed to one or more carcinogens, most commonly solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation, diesel engine exhaust, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) and benzene. The GBD study estimated that in 2016 there about 5500 cancer deaths (and 105 000 DALYs), mostly from lung cancer, arising from occupational exposures, primarily from asbestos, ETS and silica exposure, that occurred in previous decades. Conclusion: Exposure to occupational carcinogens is an important contributor to disease burden in theAustralian community. Measuring and monitoring of exposures and awareness of the burden estimates provide guidance as to where prevention and control efforts might best be targeted.",1743-7563,manual_review_correct,embase,1054,,,,156

With production expected to increase 7.6% by 2035, proximate populations remain at risk of exposure to carcinogenic coal products such as silica dust and organic compounds. It is unclear if population exposure is associated with increased risk, or even which cancers have been studied in this regard. We performed a systematic review of English-language manuscripts published since 1980 to determine if coal mining exposure was associated with increased cancer risk (incidence and mortality). Of 34 studies identified, 27 studied coal mining as an occupational exposure (coal miner cohort or as a retrospective risk factor) but only seven explored health effects in surrounding populations. Overall, risk assessments were reported for 20 cancer site categories, but their results and frequency varied considerably. Incidence and mortality risk assessments were: negative (no increase) for 12 sites; positive for 1 site; and discordant for 7 sites (e.g. lung, gastric). However, 10 sites had only a single study reporting incidence risk (4 sites had none), and 11 sites had only a single study reporting mortality risk (2 sites had none). The ecological study data were particularly meager, reporting assessments for only 9 sites. While mortality assessments were reported for each, 6 had only a single report and only 2 sites had reported incidence assessments. The reported assessments are too meager, and at times contradictory, to make definitive conclusions about population cancer risk due to coal mining. However, the preponderance of this and other data support many of Hill's criteria for causation. The paucity of data regarding population exposure and risk, the widespread geographical extent of coal mining activity, and the continuing importance of coal for US energy, warrant further studies of population exposure and risk.",1932-6203,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1344, 1104, 1555",,,,157

We did a systematic review of the published studies on epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer in India. Literature from other countries was also reviewed. With increasing prevalence of smoking, lung cancer has reached epidemic proportions in India. It has surpassed the earlier commonest form of cancer, that of oropharynx, and now is the commonest malignancy in males in many hospitals. In addition to smoking, occupational exposure to carcinogens, indoor air pollution and dietary factors have recently been implicated in the causation of lung cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is still the commonest histological type in India in contrast to the Western countries, although adenocarcinoma is becoming more common. Molecular genetics of lung cancer has opened up new vistas of research in carcinogenesis. Various modalities for early detection through screening are being investigated. Majority of the patients have locally advanced or disseminated disease at presentation and are not candidates for surgery. Chemotherapy applied as an adjunct with radiation improves survival and the quality of life. New anticancer drugs, which have emerged during the last decade, have shown an improved efficacy-toxicity ratio.

In this review, I will summarize recent evidence from cancer genome sequencing studies to exemplify how the environment can modulate tumor genomes. and Recent findings Mutation data from cancer genomes clearly implicate the ultraviolet B component of sunlight in melanoma skin cancers, tobacco carcinogen-induced DNA damage in lung cancers and aristolochic acid, a chemical compound found in certain herbal medicines, in urothelial carcinomas of exposed populations.

The well-documented factors in lifestyle and environment causing cancer in Denmark were identified from the IARC Monograph series. The population attributable risk per cent (PAR%) and the annual number of preventable cancers were calculated for each aetiology and cancer type around the year 2000. A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix is potentially avoidable, whereas only a small proportion of breast and colorectal cancers is preventable on the given knowledge. The main causative factors include active and passive smoking, alcohol intake, exposure to asbestos and other occupational carcinogens, solar and ionising radiation, obesity, human papillomavirus infection in the female genital tract, and infection with Helicobacter pylori. More than 5000 cancers in men and almost 3500 in women annually in Denmark could have been avoided by eliminating exposure to these known carcinogens. This is equivalent to 39% and 23% of all cancers occurring respectively in men and women, around the year 2000. Smoking habits account for more than half of these avoidable cases. The incidence of cancer could be greatly reduced through primary prevention, especially of tobacco smoking, which is the major single factor. A large proportion of the cancers occurring in the lungs, larynx, upper digestive tract, skin, lower urinary tract, and the uterine cervix are potentially avoidable.

We included the two main diseases widely associated with SHS exposure: lung cancer and ischaemic heart disease. The relative risks for these diseases were selected from previously published meta-analyses. The number of deaths attributable to SHS was calculated by applying the population attributable fraction to mortality not attributable to active smoking in 2011. The analyses were stratified by sex, age and setting of exposure (home, workplace, and both combined). In addition, a sensitivity analysis was performed for distinct scenarios. In 2011, a total of 586 deaths in men and 442 deaths in women would be attributable to SHS exposure. The total number of deaths from lung cancer attributable to SHS exposure would be 124, while the total number of deaths from ischaemic heart disease would be 904. The inclusion of ex-smokers or SHS exposure in leisure time in the study would considerably increase the total number of attributable deaths (by 20% and 130%, respectively).

The situation is somewhat more straightforward in the pharmaceutical arena, not only in terms of language but also for setting clear regulatory standards. The downside of this strategy is the overuse of one-size-fits-all (OSFA) approaches. Even though OSFA approaches ensure harmonization throughout the regulatory decision-making process, they may not be adequate for all the cases. Paraphrasing the famous Albert Einstein quote of the Occam's razor principle (i.e., problem-solving/logical principle that, when you have two competing theories that make exactly the same predictions, the simpler one is the better, also known as the 'law of parsimony'), we may state that ""regulatory guidelines should be made as simple as possible but not any simpler"". In fact, during a 2006 Advisory Committee for Pharmaceutical Science meeting at the US FDA, Leslie Benet declared the then current OSFA-based bioequivalence (BE) guidelines to be Procrustean [1]. In Greek mythology, Procrustes was a robber who killed his victims in the most cruel and unusual way. He made them lie on an iron bed and would cut off body parts of the people who were too large or stretch people who were too short [2]. According to the Merriam–Webster dictionary, Procrustean takes no account of individual differences, but makes everyone the same. However, it is worth noting that the regulatory paradigm in the realm of generic drugs has advanced toward non-Procrustean approaches, for example, with the Biopharmaceutics Classification System-based biowaiver decisions, as well as reference-scaled average BE for highly variable drugs, keeping the pace with the modern era of individualized and precision medicine [3,4].Demonstration of therapeutic equivalence for so-called 'complex generics' however remains challenging, as recently stated by the FDA Commissioner [5]. In order to approach these more complex scenarios, respective cases can be subdivided into four different categories: complex routes of delivery; complex formulations; complex drug substances and complex drug–device combination.First, there are complex routes of delivery (e.g., locally acting ophthalmic drugs). Due to the very low to undetectable levels of drug in the systemic circulation following the administration of ophthalmics, traditional average BE studies, focusing on systemic exposure metrics to compare test (T) and reference (R) formulations, is not adequate. In this case, the FDA has recommended two alternative approaches: in vitro or in vivo patient studies. If T and R formulations are qualitatively (Q1) and quantitatively (Q2) the same, extensive comparative physicochemical characterization in vitro may be enough to declare BE. For example, particle size distribution should be compared using population BE, a concept that was intensely debated throughout the 1990s, but has not been formally incorporated in the legal framework related to generics until recently. Alternatively, for non-Q1/Q2 products containing ophthalmic corticosteroids, pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in aqueous humor of patients undergoing indicated cataract surgery is recommended. Since noncompartmental analysis is rather sensitive to the number of sampling time points, alternative statistical approaches intended to characterize the time course of systemic drug exposure (including utilization of bootstrapping to estimate respective standard deviations) or population-based models are required [6,7]. For drugs intended to treat chronic open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension or pain and inflammation associated with cataract surgery, BE is established based on the clinical end points, for instance the difference in intraocular pressure and proportion of subjects with cure at postop day 14 [6].The second category encompasses complex formulations (e.g., liposomes). In this case, similar systemic exposure, in terms of total drug content, does not necessarily mean similarity in tissue exposure. In fact, formulation-dependent target site distribution has already been reported in both preclinical and clinical situations for parenteral products containing pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension [8,9]. Thus, the most challenging issue in demonstrating BE between complex formulations is to identify the most therapeutically relevant surrogate to bridge the gap between systemic exposure and target site disposition [3]. Consequently, BE demonstration generally implies analyzing the total and unbound or free and encapsulated drug concentrations. Additionally, comparison of in vitro particle/liposome size distribution using the population BE approach and demonstration of compositional equivalence are also recommended.For complex drug substances (e.g., synthetic peptides and copolymers), the main issue does not arise from BE assessment per se but from the demonstration of absence of differences between active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) by different manufacturers. Glatiramer acetate is a classical representative of this category. While its formulation is rather simple (e.g., prefilled syringe containing 1 ml solution with 20 mg of glatiramer acetate and 40 mg of mannitol), showing the mixture of peptide copolymers is the same in T and R formulations is rather challenging. The state-of-art knowledge advocates applying a four-stage criteria focusing on demonstrations of: equivalence of fundamental reaction scheme; equivalence of physicochemical properties including compositions; equivalence of structural signatures for polymerization and depolymerization and equivalence of biological assay results. Even though this is a synthetic drug, regulatory criteria are similar to the head-to-head comparison currently used to evaluate biosimilars. Interestingly, the biological assay can serve as a confirmatory test of equivalence and provide complementary confirmation of API sameness. In other words, similar pharmacodynamic (PD) response is ultimately used to infer back similar binding/affinity to the target and thus, similar API structure/composition [10]. Other representatives of this category are iron-based products stabilized by a complex carbohydrate, which leads to nano-sized colloidal structure. In this case, the major challenge is once more to identify the most relevant surrogate on which BE would be based. Differently from the rationale for complex formulations, measuring solely drug-bound iron in serum (e.g., difference in AUC between total iron and transferrin-bound iron) is generally chosen since it represents the amount of iron available for biological processes [3]. Notwithstanding, similar PK profiles do not discriminate the in vivo fate of drug-bound iron since it may be cleared by reticuloendothelial system uptake or by simply in vivo release of iron. Thus, it is not sufficient for the assurance of comparability of the resulting toxicological and pharmacological effects of these products. Consequently, comprehensive product characterization in vitro and tissue bio-distribution studies in animals are recommended by the regulatory authorities [3,11].Last but not the least, there are the complex drug–device combinations (e.g., metered-dose inhalers, dry powder inhalers or nasal sprays). Drug delivery characteristics of orally inhaled products (OIP) is rather dependent on the respective device, which should be similar enough without infringing on the innovator company's patent. Changing the device may be as critical as changing the amount of surfactant in an oral formulation containing a poorly soluble drug. In the case of OIP, another issue should be considered: systemic exposure is downstream of the site of action and, therefore at best, equivalent systemic exposure means equivalence in terms of safety only. Furthermore, one should consider the confluence of two routes of absorption after administering OIPs. A considerable drug fraction gets no further than the oropharynx and is swallowed. This swallowed portion may still be absorbed from the GI tract acting as a confounding factor when using systemic exposure to infer about drug delivery and local lung deposition. Consequently, the traditional PK-based OSFA approach is not suitable to address the BE of OIP. Indeed, a combination of in vitro, PK and PD studies are required. Importantly, when PD biomarkers are used directly to assess BE, doses need to be used that lie in the steep part of the dose–response curve for efficacy; otherwise, the biopharmaceutical aspect of the BE might be neglected [12].ConclusionThe above-listed examples of complex drugs comprise high-cost medicines and, generally, the branded drugs face no market competition due to the difficulties surrounding generic development, even if the patents have already expired. Therefore, developing scientifically sound, product-specific requirements is imperative. In this regard, regulatory authorities have announced new policies, focusing on adopting more rigorous and sophisticated science, including quantitative methods and computational modeling in drug development, evaluation and review [13]. In fact, using integrative approaches like the model-informed drug development, which includes PKPD models, mechanistic absorption models, physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, systems pharmacology and quantitative risk modeling) may be useful to improve drug development knowledge management and decision-making on a non-Procrustean way.Financial & competing interests disclosureThe authors have no relevant affiliations or financial involvement with any organization or entity with a financial interest in or financial conflict with the subject matter or materials discussed in the manuscript.

Most of the previous studies were in highly exposed industrial cohorts. Our aim was to quantify lung cancer burden attributable to occupational carcinogens in a general population. We applied a new job-exposure matrix (JEM) to translate lifetime work histories, collected by personal interview and coded into standard job titles, into never, low and high exposure levels for six known/suspected occupational lung carcinogens in the Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) population-based case-control study, conducted in Lombardy region, Italy, in 2002-05. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in men (1537 cases and 1617 controls), by logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders, including smoking and co-exposure to JEM carcinogens. The population attributable fraction (PAF) was estimated as impact measure. Men showed an increased lung cancer risk even at low exposure to asbestos (OR: 1.76; 95% CI: 1.42-2.18), crystalline silica (OR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.00-1.71) and nickel-chromium (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.90-1.53); risk increased with exposure level. For polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, an increased risk (OR: 1.64; 95% CI: 0.99-2.70) was found only for high exposures. The PAFs for any exposure to asbestos, silica and nickel-chromium were 18.1, 5.7 and 7.0%, respectively, equivalent to an overall PAF of 22.5% (95% CI: 14.1-30.0).

There is no cancer epidemic except for cancer of the lung due to smoking. Cancer mortality rates have declined 19 percent since 1950 (excluding lung cancer). Regulatory policy that focuses on traces of synthetic chemicals is based on misconceptions about animal cancer tests. Recent research indicates that rodent carcinogens are not rare. Half of all chemicals tested in standard high-dose animal cancer tests, whether occurring naturally or produced synthetically, are “carcinogens”; there are high-dose effects in rodent cancer tests that are not relevant to low-dose human exposures and that contribute to the high proportion of chemicals that test positive. The focus of regulatory policy is on synthetic chemicals, although 99.9 percent of the chemicals humans ingest are natural. More than 1000 chemicals have been described in coffee: 30 have been tested and 21 are rodent carcinogens. Plants in the human diet contain thousands of natural “pesticides” produced by plants to protect themselves from insects and other predators: 71 have been tested and 37 are rodent carcinogens. There is no convincing evidence that synthetic chemical pollutants are important as a cause of human cancer. Regulations targeted to eliminate low levels of synthetic chemicals are expensive. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has estimated that environmental regulations cost society $140 billion/year. Others have estimated that the median toxic control program costs 146 times more per hypothetical life-year saved than the median medical intervention. Attempting to reduce tiny hypothetical risks has other costs as well: If reducing synthetic pesticides makes fruits and vegetables more expensive, thereby decreasing consumption, then the cancer rate will increase, especially for the poor. The prevention of cancer will come from knowledge obtained from biomedical research, education of the public, and life-style changes made by individuals. A reexamination of priorities in cancer prevention, both public and private, seems warranted. In this chapter we highlight nine misconceptions about pollution, pesticides, and the causes of cancer. We briefly present the scientific evidence that undermines each misconception.",,abstract_added,openalex,1605,,,,168

The group decided to name this document The Helsinki Criteria . The requirement for diagnostic criteria was perceived in part because of new developments in diagnostic methods, with better identification of asbestos-related disorders. Such developments enhance awareness of health hazards imposed by asbestos, lead to practical prevention and appropriate compensation, and also provide opportunity to carry out international comparisons. They also provide possible models for the risk assessment of other mineral dusts. The meeting was attended by 19 participants from 8 countries not producing asbestos. The chairmen were Professor Douglas W Henderson (Flinders Medical Centre, Australia) and Professor Jorma Rantanen (Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Finland). The group was a multidisciplinary gathering of pathologists, radiologists, occupational and pulmonary physicians, epidemiologists, toxicologists, industrial hygienists, and clinical and laboratory scientists specializing in tissue fiber analysis. Collectively, the group has published over 1000 articles on asbestos and associated disorders. This document is based on a more comprehensive report providing scientific evidence for the conclusions and recommendations ( People and Work Research Reports , no 14, Finnish Institute of Occupational Health, Helsinki, 1997). The meeting was scientifically supported by leading institutions in the field of asbestos research, and it was funded by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health and the Finnish Work Environment Fund General considerations Occupational exposures to asbestos dust have been widespread in all industrial countries and continue as a consequence of ""in-place"" materials. In detailed interviews about 20% to 40% of adult men report some past occupations and jobs that may have entailed asbestos exposure at work. In Western Europe, North America, Japan, and Australia the use of asbestos peaked in the 1970s, and currently about 10 000 mesotheliomas and 20 000 asbestos-induced lung cancers are estimated to occur annually in the population of approximately 800 million people. In general, reliable work histories provide the most practical and useful measure of occupational asbestos exposure. Using structured questionnaires and checklists, trained interviewers can identify persons who have a work history compatible with significant asbestos exposure. Dust measurements can be used in the estimation of past fiber levels at typical workplaces and in the use of asbestos-containing materials. A cumulative fiber dose, as expressed in fiber-years per cubic centimeter, is an important parameter of asbestos exposure. The clinical diagnosis of asbestos-related diseases is based on a detailed interview of the patient and occupational data on asbestos exposure and appropriate latency, signs and symptoms, radiological and lung physiology findings, and selected cytological, histological and other laboratory studies. Histopathological confirmation is required for suspected asbestos-related malignancies and for the resolution of differential diagnoses. A multidisciplinary approach is suggested for the evaluation of problem cases. The chest radiograph is the basic tool for identifying asbestos-related diseases such as asbestosis, pleural abnormalities, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. The limitation of the chest radiograph in the detection of asbestosis and asbestos-associated pleural abnormalities is widely recognized. Computed tomography (CT) and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) can facilitate the detection of asbestosis and asbestos-related pleural abnormalities, as well as asbestos-related malignancies; they are not recommended as a screening tool but may be invaluable for individual clinical evaluation and research purposes. Examples are the detection of pleural abnormalities in suspected cases of asbestosis and the detection of parenchymal disease obscured on the chest film and also use as an aid to differential diagnosis. As new imaging techniques such as digital radiography are evolving, standard images and interpretations must be developed. The place of other imaging techniques (ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, gallium scanning, ventilation-perfusion studies, positron-emission tomography) has yet to be established, and they are not currently recommended for the clinical diagnosis of asbestos-related disorders. Analysis of lung tissue for asbestos fibers and asbestos bodies can provide data to supplement the occupational history. For clinical purposes, the following guidelines are recommended to identify persons with a high probability of exposure to asbestos dust at work: over 0.1 million amphibole fibers (&gt;5 µm) per gram of dry lung tissue or over 1 million amphibole fibers (&gt;1 µm) per gram of dry lung tissue as measured by electron microscopy in a qualified laboratory or over 1000 asbestos bodies/g dry tissue (100 asbestos bodies per gram of wet tissue) or over 1 asbestos body per milliliter of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, as measured by light microscopy in a qualified laboratory. Each laboratory should establish its own reference values. The median values for occupationally exposed populations should be substantially above the reference values. Efforts to standardize analytical methods for fiber burden analyses by different laboratories are recommended Asbestosis Asbestosis is defined as diffuse interstitial fibrosis of the lung as a consequence of exposure to asbestos dust. Neither the clinical features nor the architectual tissue abnormalities sufficiently differ from those of other causes of interstitial fibrosis to allow confident diagnosis without a history of significant exposure to asbestos dust in the past or the detection of asbestos fibers or bodies in the lung tissue greatly in excess of that commonly seen in the general population. Symptoms of asbestosis include dyspnea, and cough. Common findings are inspiratory basilar crackles and, less commonly, clubbing of the fingers. Functional disturbances can include gas exchange abnormalities, a restrictive pattern, and obstructive features due to small airway disease. Asbestosis is generally associated with relatively high exposure levels with radiological signs of parenchymal fibrosis. However, it is possible that mild fibrosis may occur at lower exposure levels, and the radiological criteria need not always be fulfilled in cases of histologically detectable parenchymal fibrosis. The recognition of asbestosis by chest radiography is best guided by standardized methods such as the classification of the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and its modifications. Standard films must always be used. For research and screening purposes, radiological findings of small opacities, grade 1/0, are usually regarded as an early stage of asbestosis. Inspiratory basilar rales, restrictive impairment, small airway obstruction, and gas exchange disturbances in pulmonary function are considered valuable information for clinical diagnosis, for occupational health practice, and for attribution purposes. HRCT can confirm radiological findings of asbestosis and show early changes not seen on chest X rays, but should be performed only in selected cases. Smoking effects should be considered in the evaluation of early asbestosis, lung function tests, and respiratory symptoms. A histological diagnosis of asbestosis requires the identification of diffuse interstitial fibrosis in well inflated lung tissue remote from a lung cancer or other mass lesion, plus the presence of either 2 or more asbestos bodies in tissue with a section area of 1 cm 2 or a count of uncoated asbestos fibers that falls into the range recorded for asbestosis by the same laboratory. In order to achieve reasonable comparability between different studies, a standardized system for the histological diagnosis and grading of asbestosis is required. The Roggli-Pratt modification of the CAP-NIOSH system is recommended as a reasonably simple and reproducible scheme for this purpose. There is evidence that rare cases of asbestosis occur without significant numbers of asbestos bodies. These cases are recognizable&mdash;and distinguishable from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&mdash;only by analysis of the uncoated fiber burden. Rare cases of asbestosis in relation to the inhalation of pure chrysotile can occur, with a prolonged interval between the last exposure and the diagnosis and few or no detectable asbestos bodies and a low fiber burden. The existence of such cases is speculative and, if the diagnosis can be made, it must be done from other compelling clinical or radiological grounds combined with exposure data. Fibro-inflammatory patterns other than conventional asbestosis have also been described for workers with occupational exposure to asbestos, including a pattern resembling desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), the occurrence of granulomatous inflammation, a picture that resembles lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia, and organizing pneumonia with bronchiolitis obliterans. Although the DIP-like picture with asbestos bodies is probably asbestos-related, the other patterns have not yet been shown to be so related Pleural disorders Asbestos-related pleural abnormalities are divided into pleural plaques, mainly involving the parietal pleura, sometimes with calcification, and diffuse pleural thickening, which is a collective name for pleural reactions involving mainly the visceral pleura. These include benign asbestos-related pleural effusion, blunted costophrenic angle, crow`s feet or pleuroparenchymal fibrous strands, and rounded atelectasis. Avoidance of the term ""pleural asbestosis"" is recommended. Pleural plaques are usually asymptomatic, and without clinically important findings. The specificity of pleural plaques according to the ILO 1980 Classification of Radiographs of Pneumoconioses is low unless the plaques are radiographically well defined. The most common differential diagnosis is subpleural fat. Radiographic findings are reliable for the diagnosis of asbestos-related pleural plaques when they are characteristic (eg, bilateral circumscribed plaques, bilateral calcification, diaphragmatic plaques). Pleural plaques represent circumscribed areas of fibrous thickening, typically of the parietal pleura, due to the deposition of paucicellular collagenous tissue with a laminar or basket-weave pattern; they may or may not calcify. In regions where plaques are not endemic, 80&ndash;90% of the plaques that are radiologically well defined are attributable to occupational asbestos exposure. The presence of pleural plaques may justify follow-up among occupationally exposed groups. Diffuse pleural fibrosis designates noncircumscribed fibrous thickening of variable cellularity, which usually affects the parietal, but mainly the visceral, layers. In the setting of occupational asbestos exposure, such diffuse fibrosis is probably a result of benign asbestos pleuritis with effusion. It may or may not be associated with rounded atelectasis. Diffuse pleural thickening can be associated with mild, or rarely moderate or severe, restrictive pulmonary function defects. Low exposures from work-related, household, and natural sources may induce pleural plaques. For diffuse pleural thickening, higher exposure levels may be required Mesothelioma Malignant mesothelioma affecting any serosal membrane may be induced by asbestos inhalation. The histological, immunohistochemical and ultrastructural markers for the diagnosis of mesothelioma are well established. Expert opinion should be sought on atypical cases, or on those in which the diagnosis is uncertain because of discordant findings or in which the amount of material available is insufficient for definite diagnosis. Mesothelioma is frequently presented with pleural effusion, dyspnea and chest pain. With the exception of certain histological types of mesothelioma that are benign or of uncertain or borderline malignant potential (eg, multicystic mesothelioma, benign papillary mesothelioma), all types of malignant mesothelioma can be induced by asbestos, with the amphiboles showing greater carcinogenic potency than chrysotile. A lung fiber count exceeding the background range for the laboratory in question or the presence of radiographic or pathological evidence of asbestos-related tissue injury (eg, asbestosis or pleural plaques) or histopathologic evidence of abnormal asbestos content (eg, asbestos bodies in histologic sections of lung) should be sufficient to relate a case of pleural mesothelioma to asbestos exposure on a probability basis. In the absence of such markers, a history of significant occupational, domestic, or environmental exposure to asbestos will suffice for attribution. There is evidence that peritoneal mesotheliomas are associated with higher levels of asbestos exposure than pleural mesotheliomas are. In some circumstances, exposures such as those occurring among household members may approach occupational levels. The question in unresolved of whether or not a case of mesothelioma for which the lung fiber count falls within the range recorded for unexposed urban dwellers is related to asbestos. More information is needed regarding the interpretation of fiber burdens in the pleura or samples of tumor tissue before these measures can be used for the purposes of attribution. The following points need to be considered in the assessment of occupational etiology: &bull; The great majority of mesotheliomas are due to asbestos exposure. &bull; Mesothelioma can occur in cases with low asbestos exposure. However, very low background environmental exposures carry only an extremely low risk. &bull; About 80% of mesothelioma patients have had some occupational exposure to asbestos, and therefore a careful occupational and environmental history should be taken. &bull; An occupational history of brief or low-level exposure should be considered sufficient for mesothelioma to be designated as occupationally related. &bull; A minimum of 10 years from the first exposure is required to attribute the mesothelioma to asbestos exposure, though in most cases the latency interval is longer (eg, on the order of 30 to 40 years). &bull; Smoking has no influence on the risk of mesothelioma Lung cancer All 4 major histological types (squamous, adeno-, large-cell and small-cell carcinoma) can be related to asbestos. The histological type of a lung cancer and its anatomic location (central or peripheral, upper lobe versus lower lobe) are of no significant value in deciding whether or not an individual lung cancer is attributable to asbestos. Clinical signs and symptoms of asbestos-related cancer do not differ from those of lung cancer of other causes. As examples, 1 year of heavy exposure (eg, manufacture of asbestos products, asbestos spraying, insulation work with asbestos materials, demolition of old buildings) or 5&ndash;10 years of moderate exposure (eg, construction, shipbuilding) may increase the lung cancer risk 2-fold or more. In some circumstances of extremely high asbestos exposure, a 2-fold risk of lung cancer can be achieved with exposure of less than 1 year. The relative risk of lung cancer is estimated to increase 0.5&ndash;4% for each fiber per cubic centimeter per year (fiber-years) of cumulative exposure. With the use of the upper boundary of this range, a cumulative exposure of 25 fiber-years is estimated to increase the risk of lung cancer 2-fold. Clinical cases of asbestosis may occur at comparable cumulative exposures. A 2-fold risk of lung cancer is related to retained fiber levels of 2 million amphibole fibers (&gt;5 µm) per gram of dry lung tissue or 5 million amphibole fibers (&gt;1µm) per gram of dry lung tissue. This lung fiber concentration is approximately equal to 5000 to 15 000 asbestos bodies per gram of dry tissue, or 5 to 15 asbestos bodies per milliliter of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. When asbestos body concentrations are less than 10 000 asbestos bodies per gram of dry tissue, electron microscopic fiber analyses are recommended. Chrysotile fibers do not accumulate within lung tissue to the same extent as amphiboles because of faster clearance rates; therefore, occupational histories (fiber-years of exposure) are probably a better indicator of lung cancer risk from chrysotile than fiber burden analysis is. A lung fiber burden within the range recorded for asbestosis in the same laboratory should be assigned a significance similar to that of asbestosis. For a patient with lung cancer and a fiber count that falls within the range recorded for unexposed urban dwellers, the relationship of the tumor to amphibole asbestos is doubtful at most. Estimates of the relative risk for asbestos-associated lung cancer are based on different-sized populations. Because of the high incidence of lung cancer in the general population, it is not possible to prove in precise deterministic terms that asbestos is the causative factor for an individual patient, even when asbestosis is present. However, attribution of causation requires reasonable medical certainty on a probability basis that the agent (asbestos) has caused or contributed materially to the disease. The likelihood that asbestos exposure has made a substantial contribution increases when the exposure increases. Cumulative exposure, on a probability basis, should thus be considered the main criterion for the attribution of a substantial contribution by asbestos to lung cancer risk. For example, relative risk is roughly doubled for cohorts exposed to asbestos fibers at a cumulative exposure of 25 fiber-years or with an equivalent occupational history, at which level asbestosis may or may not be present or detectable. Heavy exposure, in the absence of radiologically diagnosed asbestosis, is sufficient to increase the risk of lung cancer. Cumulative exposures below 25 fiber-years are also associated with an increased risk of lung cancer, but to a less extent. The presence of asbestosis is an indicator of high exposure. Asbestosis may also contribute some additional risk of lung cancer beyond that conferred by asbestos exposure alone. Asbestosis diagnosed clinically, radiologically (including HRCT), or histologically can be used to attribute a substantial causal or contributory role to asbestos for an associated lung cancer. Pleural plaques are an indicator of exposure to asbestos fibers. Because pleural plaques may be associated with low levels of asbestos exposure, the attribution of lung cancer to asbestos exposure must be supported by an occupational history of substantial asbestos exposure or measures of asbestos fiber burden. Bilateral diffuse pleural thickening is often associated with moderate or heavy exposures, as seen in cases with asbestosis, and should be considered accordingly in terms of attribution. A minimum lag-time of 10 years from the first asbestos exposure is required to attribute the lung cancer to asbestos. Not all exposure criteria need to be fulfilled for the purposes of attribution. For example, the following can be considered: (i) significant occupational exposure history with low fiber burdens (eg, long exposure to chrysotile and long lag-time between the end of exposure and mineralogical analysis) and (ii) high fiber counts in lung or broncholavage fluid with an uncertain history or without long-term duration (short exposures can be very intense). At very low levels of asbestos exposure, the risk of lung cancer appears to be undetectably low. Although tobacco smoking affects the total lung cancer risk, this effect does not detract from the risk of lung cancer attributable to asbestos exposure. No attempt has been made in this report to apportion the relative contributions of asbestos exposure and tobacco smoking Prevention and screening Screening of asbestos-exposed populations can be carried out for practical and scientific purposes. There are 4 goals of screening: (i) to identify high risk groups, (ii) to target preventive actions, (iii) to discover occupational diseases, and (iv) to develop improved tools for treatment, rehabilitation and prevention. Screening should aim to prevent asbestos-related diseases and therefore lead to gained healthy years of life among the screened or among those in similar risk situations. The benefits to the individual person should be viewed cautiously. The substantial morbidity and mortality related to asbestos exposure argue for continued efforts to increase the preventive power of screening. Any screening for purely scientific purposes requires appropriate methods and criteria (eg, low cost and high predictive value). Before a screening program is initiated, the ethical, financial, and legislative aspects need to be considered. These aspects may include patient notification, data protection, allocation of costs, and follow-up of identified abnormalities. In addition, provision should be made for epidemiologic analyses, quality control, primary and secondary prevention, and the assessment of program effectiveness. As tools for screening, questionnaires and personal interviews should include items related to asbestos exposure, smoking, and other contributing factors. Questionnaires should preferably be validated for smoking habits and occupational histories. When possible, questionnaires should be applied nationally to permit epidemiologic analysis of the results. Chest X-ray examinations can include frontal and lateral roentgenograms. Appropriate lung function tests can measure respiratory flow volumes and rates. In spirometry, attention should be given to careful calibration, acceptable performance efforts, and reproducibility. The prevention strategies of asbestos-related diseases can be based on the identification of exposure sources and exposed people. There are 3 main targets for prevention: (i) an individual worker, (ii) a selected group of workers, and (iii) the work environment. At the level of the individual worker, the tools for prevention include health education and the introduction of safe work practices, the avoidance of tobacco smoking, and careful follow-up of health by surveillance. The group level methods are in part the same as at the individual level (ie, health information, education, and recommendations including the use of respiratory protective equipment). The work environment is the most important target for preventive measures, starting from avoiding the use of asbestos, carefully controlling dust emissions using wet techniques, and controlling passive smoking at the workplace. Many countries have prohibited the use of asbestos, but there are still substantial amounts of asbestos in consumer products and in buildings that can expose workers in repair and removal work. Some countries have permitted asbestos work only under special authorization, training, and protective measures. From the knowledge on potential exposures to asbestos, high-risk populations can be identified among persons exposed 10 or more years ago. The availability of registers&mdash;union, workers` compensation, and employment records&mdash;can be explored for this purpose. Subjects can be assigned to subgroups for intervention or screening as defined by their risk (eg, the current risk of lung cancer and risk projected to given time windows in the future). Criteria for inclusion in each intervention or screening group should be established in the study protocol. Subsequently, the members of each subgroup can serve as separate targets for group-based and individual intervention programs. Protocols for intervention should be designed in such a way that they serve each subject and subgroup optimally in terms of promoting individual health and the early detection of asbestos-related diseases. Data on these subgroups can also form a basis for more specific studies of disease outcome or various biomarkers. Identified abnormalities should be followed by the best clinical and occupational practices. Reserach needs There are several issues that still require clarification and further study. The following list of recommendations and future directions is not intended to be exhaustive. &bull; Improvement in the assessment and quantification of exposure to asbestos, to include specific worker groups, with collation of data and the development of an international standardized protocol for the assessment of exposure. &bull; Further analysis of job-exposure data and further studies on asbestos fiber burdens in tissue in relation to various asbestos-related disorders. &bull; Studies on chrysotile fiber burdens in lung tissue relative to the risk of lung cancer (also to include experimental investigations). &bull; Lung cancer relative to the lung tissue burdens of mineral fibers other than asbestos (eg, refractory ceramic fibers and zeolites). &bull; Improvement of the ILO system for the radiological diagnosis and categorization of pleural abnormalities. &bull; Development of a standardized system for the reporting of HRCT scans of asbestos-related disorders, analogous to the ILO system. &bull; Studies on the specificity of lesions of the pleura visualized by CT as markers of asbestos exposure and studies on the prognosis of diffuse pleural abnormalities. &bull; Improvement in ultrasound imaging of the pleura. &bull; Development of new digital imaging techniques for the investigation of asbestos-related diseases. &bull; Standardization of the approach to lung crepitations with the use of special auditory devices. &bull; Investigation of mesothelioma as a potential outcome of exposure to mineral fibers other than asbestos&mdash;such as refractory ceramic fibers&mdash;to include experimental studies and a series of mesothelioma patients without exposure to asbestos or erionite, supported by lung tissue fiber analysis. &bull; Multicenter studies on biomarkers for the detection of early asbestos diseases and the assessment of the response to new treatment modalities. &bull; Investigation of asbestos-associated tumors other than lung cancer and mesothelioma (eg, laryngeal carcinoma and renal carcinoma). &bull; Further studies on the effectiveness of screening programs.

This is part of a larger effort to estimate the current burden of occupational cancers in Canada. Method Relative risks were selected from two recent studies of miners and truckers with quantitative exposure-response. CAREX Canada estimates of exposure prevalence and level by detailed industry and occupation were supplemented by a literature search for DEE measurement data. For each exposure group, RRs were assigned based upon the estimated mean exposure. Employment trends of industries and occupations were based upon census data from multiple years. Annual Labour Force Survey data were used to attribute age- and tenure-distribution, as well as short-term turnover characteristics. Survival was adjusted to age at entry into the exposed cohort during the risk exposure period 1961-2001. The attributable fraction (AF) for DEE-related lung cancers will be calculated by province, sex, industry and occupation. Results Approximately 1.4 million workers were exposed to DEE during the risk exposure period. The initial estimated AFs for DEE-related lung cancers are: 4.92% for males, 0.29% for females, and 2.70% overall. Conclusions These burden estimates are somewhat higher than recent estimates from other groups (1.3-1.8%). They account for the most recent evidence for the risk of lung cancer from occupational DEE exposure, as well as detailed historical exposure assessment and labour force trends.

The aim of this presentation is to provide an overview of burden of disease methods and results as applied to occupational disorders, focusing on the strengths and limitations. Methods Global burden of disease studies were conducted in 1996 and the early 2000s and are now being repeated with updated methodology. The methodology for risk factor assessment is based on an attributable fraction approach, requiring information on prevalence of exposure and relative risk. Evidence must be “strong” enough to warrant inclusion of the exposure-disorder pairing. Results The main findings from earlier studies were that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, noise-induced hearing loss, asthma and a range of cancers were the main sources of disability arising from work-related exposures. The new study includes a wider range of exposures and disorders. The approach necessarily requires comprises in terms of exposures and disorders that can be included and restricts the type of information available for analysis. These restrictions result in an underestimate of the scope of the problem for some disorders. Analyses conducted at national level are able to overcome some of these restrictions.

291,1666,"Roel Vermeulen, Marc Chadeau-Hyam",2012,Epidemiology,10.1097/ede.0b013e31826cc1cb,Commentary,900-901,23,6,"Risk of chronic disease may be governed not only by cumulative levels of exposure but also by dynamic aspects of the exposure history. These dynamic aspects include characteristics of the exposure history itself (such as duration of exposure or time-varying intensities of exposure) as well as aspects of age-related susceptibility. The latter has been formalized in concepts of the exposome1 and life-course epidemiology,2 in which the risk of chronic disease can vary according to exposures at critical time-periods in life. The approach proposed by Richardson et al3 in this issue of Epidemiology refines well-established regression models to efficiently account for exposure increments and their potential impact on disease risk. The proposed refinements lead to a flexible model that can accommodate between-person variability in exposure as well as within-person variation in exposure over time, thereby disentangling the effects of cumulative exposure and exposure rate. The method presents the great advantage of being readily implemented using classical software, allowing estimation of familiar statistical measures of association and easily interpretable results. As the authors illustrate with data from a cohort study of radon exposure in uranium miners and lung cancer mortality, this model represents an efficient extension of classical regression models of disease risk, accounting for the impact of full exposure history at the individual level. Results from the example suggest a positive association between lung cancer risk and cumulative radon exposure, with effect modification by an inverse-exposure-rate effect. These results suggest that dynamics in individual radon exposure histories are indeed important in modeling disease risk. Similar observations have been made for several other exposures, including arsenic, cigarette smoke, and alcohol—although these studies did not account for within-person variations in exposure. The model proposed by Richardson and co-workers3 is an elegant and efficient extension of this previous work. There are a few methodological aspects that may need further consideration. For example, such models require high-quality longitudinal exposure data. Although exposure assessment methods have certainly improved over time, most exposure measures are undoubtedly inexact. Where measurement errors (or errors in important covariates) are differential by exposure intensity (rate) or over time, this could lead to biased risk estimates in dynamic models of exposure. Given the high quality of historical exposure data for radon and also for smoking, those exposure examples are potentially best-case scenarios (certainly better than most occupational exposures). A second consideration is that the suggested models are strongly parametric. Although the authors mention the possibility of accommodating nonlinear relationships in their model (through spline functions, for instance), we can expect that allowing flexible parametric forms for each of the risk determinants would lead to complex models and potential computational difficulties. Notwithstanding these methodological considerations, the proposed model provides an example of how such models can offer a richer description of epidemiologic associations. Such insights may be important when risk assessments are based on epidemiologic results that assess cumulative exposures without consideration of exposure patterns or age-related susceptibility. If the risk with two equal cumulative exposures differs with low intensity and long duration compared with high intensities and short duration, this could lead to different conclusions about exposure limits and health. The same would be true if exposures after a certain age were associated with higher risk than similar exposures at a younger age (observed for benzene and leukemia, for example).4 Models that encompass these dynamic aspects should therefore be encouraged in risk modeling. Such models may also provide information about biologic pathways of disease, leading to better understanding of (for instance) the impact of metabolic saturation on the observed exposure–response curve, or the natural progression of the disease. In this regard, it might be useful to introduce into chronic disease epidemiology the types of dynamic models developed for infectious disease (for example, Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered [SIR] models, which aim at the estimation of the parameters driving the transition dynamic between these three states). These approaches focus on the reconstruction of the natural history of disease at the individual (or population) level. In practice, these would be based on the same type of data as those presented in the present study, and would complement the results from regression-based models by quantifying the effect of risk determinants in terms of their abilities to reconstruct the dynamics of disease progression in each subject. Such an approach would also allow the identification of features of the exposure history that contribute to the individual (longitudinal) risk profiles. In summary, the proposed work constitutes a convincing, important, and timely extension of ways to model the risk of chronic disease, accounting for the role of dynamic patterns in the exposure history. We encourage further applications that utilize the rich information potentially hidden in individual exposure histories.

Med,10.1002/ajim.22159,Pneumoconiosis and malignant mesothelioma in a family operated metal casting business that used industrial talc from New York state,550-555,56,5,"Background: The United States is second only to the People's Republic of China in annual talc production. U.S. talc is used in the production of ceramics, paint, paper, plastics, roofing, rubber, cosmetics, flooring, caulking, and agricultural applications. A number of U.S. talc deposits consistently contain talc intergrown with amphiboles such as tremolite and/or anthophyllite. It has long been recognized that miners and millers of talc deposits are at risk for pneumoconiosis and it has recently been reported that it is prudent, on the balance of probabilities, to conclude that dusts from New York State talc ores are capable of causing mesothelioma in exposed workers. This is a report of the diagnosis of pneumoconiosis and mesothelioma in a husband and wife who operated a small metal casting business that used industrial talc from New York as a parting agent. Methods: Case reports, including medical records and exposure histories, were provided by an attorney who had also commissioned laboratory investigation of the industrial talc product used in the factory. Results: Mrs X was diagnosed with pneumoconiosis characterized by interstitial fibrosis and heavily calcified pleural plaques. Mr X had calcified pleural plaques and developed a fatal pleural mesothelioma. Samples of the industrial talc contained fibrous tremolite and anthophyllite. Conclusions: The author concludes that end users of industrial talc from New York State may be at risk of pneumoconiosis and malignant disease. End users of talcs from other regions of the United States, where talc formation arose from processes driven by regional metamorphism, might also be at risk. Am. J. Ind.

Its myriad uses as a ""miracle mineral"" owe to its remarkable properties of extreme resistance to thermal and chemical breakdown, tensile strength, and fibrous habit which allows it to be spun and woven into textiles. Abundant in nature, it has been mined considerably, and in all continents save Antarctica. The nomenclature concerning asbestos and its related species is complex, owing to the interest held therein by scientific disciplines such as geology, mineralogy and medicine, as well as legal and regulatory authorities. As fibrous silicates, asbestos minerals are broadly classified into the serpentine (chrysotile) and amphibole (crocidolite, amosite, tremolite, anthophyllite, actinolite) groups, both of which may also contain allied but nonfibrous forms of similar or even identical chemical composition, nonpathogenic to humans. Recently, fibrous amphiboles, not historically classified or regulated as asbestos (winchite, richterite), have been implicated in the causation of serious disease due to their profusion as natural contaminants of vermiculite, a commercially useful and nonfibrous silicate mineral. Although generally grouped, classified, and regulated collectively as asbestos, the serpentine and amphibole groups have different geologic occurrences and, more importantly, significant differences in crystalline structures and chemical compositions. These in turn impart differences in fiber structure and dimension, as well as biopersistence, leading to marked differences in relative potency for causing disease in humans for the group of minerals known as asbestos.",0080-0015,-1,"pubmed, embase","1362, 1133",,,,175

Thus, it is entirely appropriate for a researcher, having found that exposure to a hypothetical subtance called'zickel'is associated with a relative risk of 100 for developing contact dermatitis, to then claim that'zickel is a potent sensitiser'. Problems begin, however, when researchers get carried away with the importance of their own work and proceed to declare to the world that'zickel is an important cause of contact dermatitis'. Such a statement requires careful consideration of the health impact of that substance in absolute terms, as well as consideration of wider public health issues such as cost-effectiveness of prevention programmes, and the possible negative effects of abolishing that substance versus implementing alternative protective measures with respect to the population at risk. This chapter highlights the difference between the two main measures of risk, namely relative risk and attributable risk, and discusses their relevance to the prevention of contact dermatitis using real and hypothetical examples. Devoting an entire chapter to this topic may seem extravagant, but the conceptual jump from investigating and treating individuals to consideration of the health needs of an entire population is one which many physicians find difficult.",1421-5721,abstract_added,"pubmed, embase","1437, 1220",,,,176

Today the world carries a heavy cancer burden. Environmental factors are known to play the principal role in cancer causation. However, although much research of internationally unique quality has been published also in Finland, the use of registers has still been far from optimal due to a lack of knowledge of their possibilities, too little discussion about joint interests, negative beliefs on accessibility of the data and limited experience of multi-level linkages. We describe an ongoing nationwide register-linkage network joining relevant data and forces of motivated researchers from as many as possible research institutes, and evaluate the potential of subsequent environmental epidemiological studies. Methods: The basic study cohort consists of the Finnish Longitudinal Census Data File with cross-sectional data from the entire population from years 1970, 1975, 1980, 1985, 1990 and 1995, and a random sample of 400,000 persons from the population census of 1950. This data set is updated for dates of death and emigration. The variables for occupation, education, socioeconomic status and location coordinates of residence are extracted from various consecutive censuses. The exposures of the Finnish job-exposure matrix cover 74 exposures related to a total of 393 occupations. Geographically referenced data can be obtained from several sources. Also specific cohort studies will be used when available and more appropriate. Cancer incidence data is available from the Finnish Cancer Register. All data linkages are automatic, using as their key unique personal identification numbers, building identification codes, location coordinates or maps. Results: The planned study series is a continuation of encouraging experiences from some 200 studies based on linkable registers and collaboration in multidiscipline teams. For instance, environmental epidemiological studies have contributed to our knowledge of the relatively weak but positive associations between residential levels of radon and lung cancer, and of extremely low frequency magnetic fields and childhood leukaemia, and also suggested a positive association between arsenic concentration in well water and urinary tract cancers. A legion of studies have also been conducted on the possible carcinogenicity of occupational exposures. Discussion: We will summarize the pros and cons of the register-linkage methodology, compare some key results of Finnish environmental epidemiological studies with meta-analytical or other concensus data, and reflect on the related epidemiological challenges related to changing society.",1044-3983 1531-5487,-1,openalex,1765,,,,180

The Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) risk model estimates an individual's 5-year absolute risk of lung cancer based on five epidemiological risk factors; smoking duration, prior diagnosis of pneumonia or another cancer; family history of lung cancer including age at onset; and occupational exposure to asbestos (Cassidy et al. The LLP Risk Model: an individual risk prediction model for lung cancer. British J Cancer; 98 (2):270-6, 2008). DNA genotyping indicated a role of the SEZ6L, a Met430IIe polymorphic variant found on 22q12.2 region to have increased risk of lung cancer (Gorlov et al. Cancer Research 7: 8406-11, 2007). Therefore, we quantified the improvement in risk prediction attributed to addition of SEZ6L in the LLP risk model. SEZ6L was genotyped in 200 lung cancer patients and 188 controls from the Liverpool Lung Project, and combined with previously identified epidemiological risk factors. Bivariate association between the SNP and the epidemiological risk factors was studied using the Pearson's chi-squared test; multivariable conditional logistic regression modelled individual risk profile, which was combined with local incidence data for prediction of absolute risk of lung cancer in the next 5-year. The improvements in the models associated with the SNP was assessed through a pairwise comparison of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and the Net Reclassification Improvements (NRI). A higher proportion of homozygote mutant genotype was observed among patients (10%) compared to controls (3%). No interaction was observed between any of the epidemiological risk factors and the SEZ6L genotype, in combined or separate analysis of patients and controls. The extended model (model including the SNP genotype) showed better calibration compared to the baseline model (model with only epidemiological factors). There was a modest, but statistically significant increase when SEZ6L was incorporated into the risk model, the ROC-AUC increased from 0.72 (0.66-0.77) for the baseline model to 0.75 (0.71-0.80) for the extended model. The NRI also revealed a significant improvement of around 12% for the extended model; this improvement was even better for individuals classified into the two intermediate risk categories by the baseline model (NRI=27%). Our results suggest addition of SEZ6L improved the performance of the LLP risk model particularly for individuals whose initial absolute risks were unable to discriminate them into 'low' or 'high' risk group. However, given the small number of patients and controls included in this analysis, further validation of the observed improvement is essential.",0008-5472,-1,"embase, openalex","1138, 1744",,,,181

Because of a recent epidemiology study reporting a possible association with lung cancer risk in workers with potential dermal exposure to TDI, we evaluated the evidence from epidemiological, toxicological, and toxicokinetic studies to assess whether it is likely that dermal exposure to TDI can cause human respiratory cancers. We found that the reported associations with respiratory cancers in the epidemiology studies do not support TDI as a causal factor, as there are other explanations that are more likely than causation, such as confounding by smoking and low socioeconomic status. Experimental animal and genotoxicity studies indicate that the carcinogenic potential of TDI depends on its conversion to toluene diamine (TDA), and there is no evidence of systemic availability of TDA after dermal or inhalation exposure to TDI. Also, systemic uptake of TDI is very low after dermal exposure, and any absorbed TDI is more likely to react with biomolecules on or below the skin surface than to form TDA. Even if some TDA formation occurred after dermal exposure to TDI, TDA does not induce respiratory tract tumors in experimental animals after either dermal or oral exposure. We conclude that the available evidence indicates that dermal TDI exposure does not cause respiratory cancers in humans.",1873-6750,-1,"pubmed, embase","1326, 1062",,,,182

It accounts for 99% of current world asbestos production of 2 million tonnes. Chrysotile is an extremely hazardous material. Clinical and epidemiologic studies have established incontrovertibly that chrysotile causes cancer of the lung, malignant mesothelioma of the pleura and peritoneum, cancer of the larynx and certain gastrointestinal cancers. Chrysotile also causes asbestosis, a progressive fibrous disease of the lungs. Risk of these diseases increases with cumulative lifetime exposure to chrysotile and rises also with increasing time interval (latency) since first exposure. Comparative analyses have established that chrysotile is 2 to 4 times less potent than crocidolite asbestos in its ability to cause malignant mesothelioma, but of equal potency of causation of lung cancer. The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization has declared chrysotile asbestos a proven human carcinogen. Sales of chrysotile asbestos have virtually ended in Western Europe and North America, because of widespread recognition of its health hazards. However, asbestos sales remain strong in Japan, across Asia and in developing nations worldwide. The claim has been made that chrysotile asbestos can be used ""safely"" under ""certain conditions"" in those nations. That claim is not accurate. The Collegium Ramazzini, an international learned society in environmental and occupational medicine, has called for an immediate worldwide ban on all sales and uses of all forms of asbestos, including chrysotile. The rationale for this ban is threefold: (1) that safer substitute materials are readily available, (2) that ""controlled"" use of asbestos is not possible, and (3) that the health risks of asbestos are not acceptable in either the industrialized or the newly industrializing nations.",0019-8366,-1,"pubmed, embase","1414, 1207",,,,183

Using tobacco, active smokers can get affected to lung and cancers in other organs such as larynx, oral cavity, pharynx, esophagus, pancreas, kidney and bladder. Non–smokers who are exposed to environmental tobacco either by family members or workplace are also equally at the risk of having lung, laryngeal cancers, other respiratory diseases and even breast cancer.

Hancox,2018,Respirology,10.1111/resp.13460,When is a confounder not a confounder?,105-106,24,2,"As much as we would like to be guided by robust evidence from randomized controlled trials, the fact is that most of what we know about the causes of respiratory disease comes from observational studies (such as the associations of smoking with lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or between asbestos and mesothelioma). For many exposures, it is often unfeasible or unethical to conduct randomized controlled trials in humans and we have to rely on observing associations with outcomes in non-interventional studies. The problem, of course, is that an association does not necessarily mean causation: there will always be uncertainty about whether the association is confounded by other differences between the exposed and non-exposed groups. Researchers can minimize confounding either by designing a study to eliminate major confounders (e.g. by excluding people with the confounder) or, more often, by measuring multiple potential confounding factors and adjusting for them in the analyses. Both approaches rely on our ability to identify and measure the confounding factors. So how should we decide what is a confounder and what is not? We teach students that potential confounders are factors that are associated with the exposure and the outcome, but not on the causal pathway. However, not every factor that meets these criteria is a confounder and adjusting for multiple non-confounding factors can bias the findings. Guidance for authors of causal inference studies has recently been published in the Annals of the American Thoracic Society by the editors of 35 leading respiratory, sleep and critical care journals, including Respirology.1 This calls for a more critical approach to selecting confounders and more transparent reporting of the results of observational studies. The article points out that several commonly used methods of selecting confounding variables do not adequately control for confounding and may introduce bias. These inappropriate methods include relying on stepwise or other statistical techniques to select variables that are significantly associated with the outcome, improve model fit, or those that make a difference to the strength of the observed association. The recommended approach is to decide, a priori, on the plausible confounding factors based on what is known or hypothesized about the causal pathway. To achieve this, the article encourages the use of causal diagrams or directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). There is nothing new in using conceptual causal path diagrams to aid our thinking, but DAGs put these onto a more formal setting. Unfortunately DAGs come with unfamiliar and potentially confusing terminology (nodes, vertices, edges, back-door paths etc.) but the concept is simple enough and an excellent description and example was provided in an earlier article in Respirology.2 Variables are linked by arrows representing the causal direction: bidirectional arrows and feedback loops are not permitted (variables cannot cause themselves). Paths between variables can include one or more intervening variables and the arrows on these paths can point in either direction. One of the advantages of using DAGs is that they help us to differentiate between confounders, mediators, and colliders and therefore to select which variables need to be controlled. Mediators are usually easy to distinguish from confounders: they are intermediate variables on the causal path between exposure and outcome. Mediators may provide valuable insights into causal mechanisms and we rarely want to adjust for them unless we are interested in quantifying different causal pathways between the exposure and the outcome. Less easily distinguished are colliders—these are easily mistaken for confounders because they are associated with both the exposure and the outcome and are not on the causal pathway. Unlike confounders, colliders are caused by both the exposure and the outcome or indirectly caused by other factors associated with the exposure and the outcome. Hence, the directional arrows from both exposure and outcome ‘collide’ at the collider variable. Colliders should not be adjusted for—controlling for them can introduce confounding.1, 2 For example, if we were investigating whether having COPD was a causal risk factor for lung cancer, we would consider smoking to be a confounder because it is a cause of both COPD and lung cancer and not on the causal path (Fig. 1). It would be necessary to control for smoking history to prevent confounding of the causal path between COPD and lung cancer. Weight loss, however, is unlikely to be a confounder but could be a collider: both severe COPD and lung cancer can cause weight loss (the arrows ‘collide’ at weight loss). Hence, it would not be appropriate to adjust the analysis for weight loss. Airway oxidative stress could potentially be on the causal path and could mediate the association. It would not be appropriate to adjust for measures of airway oxidative stress either. Of course, this causal diagram is oversimplified: there many be many other plausible variables (such as occupational exposures) that could confound an association between COPD and lung cancer and these should be included. An important distinction is drawn between causal inference studies and prediction studies. For example, the 5-item CURB65 score and the 20-item Pneumonia Severity Index have both been shown to be useful predictors of death among patients with pneumonia.3, 4 It is not relevant to consider whether the various factors that comprise these scores are causes, confounders, colliders, or mediators. What is important is whether they are valid and clinically useful predictors of mortality. By contrast, causal inference studies usually investigate the association between one exposure and an outcome. Other variables (‘covariates’) are usually only of interest to the extent that they confound or mediate this association. The practice of publishing the associations between these multiple covariates and the outcome in causal inference studies is discouraged.1 This guidance provides examples of confounders, colliders and mediators, more detailed explanations about DAGs, and principles for choosing confounders, interpreting, and reporting observational studies. There are links to further reading and online resources to help draw causal diagrams.1 Following this guidance will improve the conduct and interpretation of observational research. We can anticipate that the editors of the world's leading respiratory journals will expect authors to follow it.",1323-7799 1440-1843,-1,openalex,1656,,,,186

Risk factor-based guidelines and risk model-based strategies are used to identify patients who could benefit from low-dose chest CT (LDCT) screening.

Which risk factor-based guideline or model-based strategy is most accurate in detecting lung cancers in a highly exposed occupational cohort? Fire Department of City of New York (FDNY) rescue/recovery workers exposed to the September 11, 2001 attacks underwent LDCT lung cancer screening based on smoking history and age. The USPSTF-2014, NCCN-2, PLCOm2012 model, and Bach model were retrospectively applied to determine how many lung cancers were diagnosed using each approach. Among the study population (N = 3,953), 930 underwent a baseline scan that met at least one risk factor or model-based LDCT screening strategy; 73% received annual follow-up scans. Among the 3,953, 63 lung cancers were diagnosed, of which 50 were detected by at least one LDCT screening strategy. The NCCN-2 guideline was the most sensitive (79.4%; 50/63). When compared with NCCN-2, stricter age and smoking criteria reduced sensitivity of the other guidelines/models (USPSTF-2014 [44%], PLCOm2012 [51%], and Bach[46%]). The 13 missed lung cancers were mainly attributable to smoking less and quitting longer than guideline/model eligibility criteria. False-positive rates were similar across all four guidelines/models. In this cohort, our findings support expanding eligibility for LDCT lung cancer screening by lowering smoking history from ≥30 to ≥20 pack-years and age from 55 years to 50 years old.

Oncol,,UKLS impact of utilization of risk assessment in trial selection,S114-S115,10,9,"Future implementation of lung cancer screening programmes will require accurate identification of the population who will benefit the most, to ensure that the benefits outweigh the harms [1]. In the USA, the current criteria for Medicare reimbursement [2], for screening are: age 55 to 77, a smoking history of 30 pack-years or more and smoking within 14 years of entry [3]. However, an in-depth analysis of the NLST showed that there was marked variation in individual risk of lung cancer death, with some screened that had only a low chance of benefit: 20% of participants at lowest risk accounted for only 1% of prevented lung-cancer deaths). [4]Conversely, 88% of the prevented deaths were in the 60% of participants that were at highest risk. The only risk prediction model so far utilised in the recruitment of participants into a CT Lung Cancer Screening RCT, is the LLPv2 risk model in the pilot UK lung cancer screening trial (UKLS) [5]. The Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) risk model was based on a case-control study [6]. The LLPv1 model utilised conditional logistic regression to develop a model based on factors that were significantly associated with lung cancer (smoking duration, prior diagnosis of pneumonia, occupational exposure to asbestos, prior diagnosis of cancer family history of lung cancer (early onset <60 years) and exposure to asbestosis [6]. The multivariable model was combined with age-standardised incidence data to estimate the absolute risk of developing lung cancer. The discrimination of the LLP was evaluated and demonstrated its predicted benefit for stratifying patients for CT screening by using data from three independent studies from Europe and North America [7]. The LLPv2 was used to select subjects with ≥ 5% risk of developing lung cancer in the next five years for UKLS [8]. This method may improve cost-effectiveness by limiting screening to high-risk individuals. The UKLS approached 247,354 individuals in the two pilot sites, 75,958 people (30.7%) responded positively to the screening invitation. Demographic factors associated with positive response were: higher socioeconomic status, age 56-70 years, and ex-smokers. Those from lower socioeconomic groups and current smokers were less likely to respond. 8,729 (11.5%) positive responders were calculated as high risk of lung cancer. The high risk individuals were more often elderly, current smokers, of lower socioeconomic status and males (2.4x females). 4,055 were randomised into the UKLS. Forty two UKLS participants have been diagnosed with confirmed lung cancer, 34 of these were detected at baseline or three months, giving a baseline prevalence of 1.7% which is significantly higher than that reported by the NLST[9]or NELSON [10]trials. To date, 2.1% of all individuals screened have been diagnosed with lung cancer. 36/42 (85.7%) of the screendetected cancers were identified at stage 1 or 2. Of those with a confirmed cancer, 17/42 (40.5%) were from the most deprived Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) quintile. (Figure Presented).",1556-0864,manual_review,embase,1082,,,,188

Because DMM is increasing on a worldwide basis and is making its appearance in the developing world, where it has not previously been diagnosed, appreciation of how the disease came to be noticed sheds light on its causation.

Gender-, age- and disease-specific numbers of deaths were provided by Statistics Finland for 1996. Information on the size of the population, broken down by gender, age, occupation, and industry, was acquired from population censuses. A Finnish job-exposure matrix supplied data on the prevalence of exposure for specific agents and the level of exposure among exposed workers. The attributable fraction of work-related mortality in the relevant disease and age categories was estimated to be 7% (10% for men and 2% for women), and for all diseases and ages the fraction was 4%. For the main cause-of-death categories, the attributable fraction became 12% for circulatory system diseases, 8% for malignant neoplasms, 4% for respiratory system diseases, 4% for mental disorders, 3% for nervous system diseases, and 3% for accidents and violence. The following estimates were obtained for specific important diseases: 24% for lung cancer, 17% for ischemic heart disease, 12% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 11% for stroke. Based on these fractions, the total number of work-related deaths that occurred in Finland in 1996 was calculated to be on the order of 1800 (employed work force of 2.1 million); 86% involved men. High-quality epidemiologic studies and national survey data are essential for obtaining reliable estimates of the proportion of deaths attributable to occupational factors.

At 24 hospitals in nine metropolitan areas in the United States, 1793 male lung cancer cases were matched for race, age, hospital, year of interview, and cigarette smoking (never smoker, ex-smoker, smoker (1-19 and > or = 20 cigarettes per day)) to two types of controls (cancer and non-cancer hospital patients). Information on usual occupation, exposure to specific potential carcinogens, and cigarette smoking was obtained by interview. Risk of lung cancer was increased significantly for electricians; sheetmetal workers and tinsmiths; bookbinders and related printing trade workers; cranemen, derrickmen, and hoistmen; moulders, heat treaters, annealers and other heated metal workers; and construction labourers. All of these occupations are potentially exposed to known carcinogens. Odds ratios (ORs) were increased for exposure to coal dust (adjusted OR = 1.5; 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.1-2.1). After stratification, this association was statistically significant only after 10 or more years of exposure. Lung cancer was also related to exposure to asbestos (adjusted OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.5-2.2). The ORs increased with increasing duration of exposure to asbestos for all smoking categories except for current smokers of 1-19 cigarettes per day. The statistical power to detect ORs among occupations that were previously reported to be at increased risk of lung cancer but that failed to show an OR of at least 1.5 in the current study was small. The cumulative population attributable risk (PAR) of lung cancer due to occupation was 9.2%. It is concluded that occupational factors play an important part in the development of lung cancer independently of cigarette smoking.

It is also the most common lethal work-related cancer. After tobacco smoking, occupational exposures present the most frequent specific cause of lung cancer that is amenable to intervention. Early detection and treatment can identify and cure primary lung cancer. Randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the efficacy of low dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening among persons at high risk of lung cancer. Guidelines for determining eligibility for LDCT screening have been established for the general population but have largely neglected those for whom occupational exposure to lung carcinogens is a risk factor. The Collegium recommends that persons at risk for lung cancer from occupational exposures be offered annual LDCT if their cumulative risk of lung cancer approximates the level of risk endorsed by the guidelines promulgated by the United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) in 2021 and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) in the United States in 2021. At present, these agencies recommend screening for people aged 50 and over who have smoked at least 20 pack-years of cigarettes. The Collegium recommends that additional lung cancer risk factors, including exposure to known or suspected occupational and environmental lung carcinogens; family history of lung cancer (especially among first degree relatives and relatives <60 years of age); a personal history of chronic obstructive lung disease, pneumoconiosis, or pulmonary fibrosis; or a personal history of cancer (excluding skin cancer) be considered as part of the risk assessment for eligibility determination for lung cancer screening. Latency, or the period of time since initial occupational exposure (e.g., >15 years) is another factor that should be considered. If the presence of these additional risk factors, in combination with age and smoking history, is associated with a level of risk that meets or exceeds the level of risk identified by the USPSTF and NCCN, then an annual low dose chest CT for lung cancer screening should be offered. We do not favor a specific age cut-off at which to end screening, but we recognize that only persons who are sufficiently healthy and have sufficient life expectancy to undergo diagnostic work-up and potentially curative treatment should be offered screening for lung cancer. In view of the rising risk of occupational lung cancer over time and the potential or actual interaction between occupational lung carcinogens and cigarette smoking even after quitting, screening programs may choose to screen workers with occupational lung cancer risk for prolonged periods after they have quit smoking cigarettes. The Collegium acknowledges that there are uncertainties and assumptions entailed in this approach and that risk assessment for individual workers necessitates application of significant professional judgement. We encourage the implementation of well-organized screening programs that can further our knowledge about optimal occupation-inclusive lung cancer screening strategies. Workers with a history of exposure to known or suspected lung carcinogens or working in occupations/trades or work tasks that are known to elevate the risk for lung cancer form the target population for lung cancer screening. Important examples of lung carcinogens include asbestos, silica, diesel exhaust, welding fumes, selected metals, and radiation. Screening participants should be provided with complete and comprehensible information about risks and benefits. Screening should be offered annually and continuously. Screening should be achieved through the application of low dose computed tomography (LDCT) to minimize the radiation dose delivered. Proper CT scan interpretation should be performed by experienced radiologists or other well-trained readers. Prompt, appropriate follow-up of abnormal CT scans involving relevant medical expertise is mandatory. Patients who are current smokers should be offered smoking cessation programs. The Collegium calls upon occupational health and medical professionals and stakeholders (governments, employers, insurance companies, and labor unions) to identify worker populations that have excess lung cancer risk, to promote lung cancer screening, and to develop and support well-organized programs to conduct such screening in these populations. While elimination or minimization of exposure to lung carcinogens in the workplace through environmental controls is critical for lung cancer prevention, lung cancer screening is an essential secondary intervention for reducing deaths and disabling disease from exposure to workplace lung carcinogens. Lung cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in the world, causing one in five (20.4%) cancer deaths in 2019.1 It is the most common cause of cancer death for males in most countries, including low-, middle-, and high-income nations, and the most frequent cause of cancer death among women in China, the United States, Australia, Scandinavia, and Canada. Tobacco smoking is the dominant cause of lung cancer, and the maturity of the cigarette smoking epidemic and variable uptake and adoption of smoking cessation determines much of the geographic and gender variation in lung cancer incidence and mortality.2 Lung cancer is also the dominant cause of occupational cancer (excluding nonmelanoma skin cancers), causing more than 50% of all workplace-related cancers.3 A recent analysis associated with the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 estimated that 300,000 lung cancer deaths occurred as a result of exposure to 10 IARC Group 1 lung carcinogens in 2016, representing 86% of all occupational cancer deaths.4 Work-related lung cancer deaths increased 55% from 1990 to 2016, from an estimated 193,000–300,000 deaths per year (GBD 2016 Occupational Carcinogens Collaborators 2020). Excellent reviews of occupational cancer in general are readily available.5-7 Occupational lung cancer remains grossly neglected by public health surveillance, clinical medicine, and worker compensation systems, despite its enormous burden of illness and death. Studies in diverse populations and industries across three continents (Asia, Europe, and North America) have demonstrated that a very small fraction—less than 3%—of the total number of estimated occupational lung cancers have been attributed to occupation. In Korea, where an estimated 630 to 1181 occupational lung cancers occur annually, only 179 work-related lung cancers, or 10 per year on average, were compensated by the Korean national worker compensation system over a nearly two-decade period.8, 9 In Great Britain, where 5442 occupational lung cancer cases are estimated to occur each year,10 only 21 cases per year (or 392 cases over a 19 year period, 1996–2014) were recorded in Surveillance of Work-Related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD), a national voluntary reporting system.11 Similarly, in Canada, of the estimated 4150 annual occupational lung cancer cases, only 120 occupational lung cancers were compensated each year between 2005 and 2009.7, 12 Over the past five decades, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has identified 20 IARC Group 1 occupational lung carcinogens (substances or mixtures) and an additional 7 occupations, industries or work processes in which occupational epidemiology studies were instrumental in establishing specific lung carcinogenicity.5 These agents, occupations and industries are listed in Table 1, adapted from IARC sources.5, 13 Four in ten of all agent-specific IARC Group 1 carcinogens cause lung cancer. In addition, two-thirds of all occupations, industries, or processes that cause occupational cancer cause lung cancer (Table 1).

They include cobalt,2, 3, 7, 8 tetrachlorordibenzo-para-dioxin (dioxin), and high temperature frying emissions and total eight agents or mixtures and four occupations, industries or processes (Table 1).13 The number of occupational lung carcinogens are increasing. In the past decade alone, IARC has added common exposures such as diesel engine exhaust (2013), outdoor air pollution (2016), and welding fumes (2017) to its Group 1 list of carcinogens (Table 1).5, 13 For additional carcinogens, there is limited evidence for an association with lung cancer: emissions from combustion of biomass fuel (2010); bitumens from roofing (2013); diazinon (2017); and hydrazine (2018). The occupational lung cancer burden is likely to grow. Only a small fraction of the tens of thousands of chemical agents in commercial use have been evaluated for toxicity. In five decades, IARC has evaluated more than 1000 agents, occupations and industries, but found that available scientific studies are inadequate or lacking in approximately one-half of the evaluations.5, 14 For context, there are an estimated 86,000 chemicals in the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Toxic Substances Control Act Inventory.15 Given the frequency of exposure of the respiratory system to inhaled toxicants and the demonstrated carcinogenicity of many chemical agents, it is likely that only a fraction of occupational lung carcinogens has been identified and the total burden of occupational lung cancer remains undefined. Exposure to occupational lung carcinogens has been and remains reasonably common. National and cross-national surveys of workplace exposures have been conducted in high income countries for 4 decades, including the US National Occupational Hazard and Exposure Surveys (1972–1974 and 1981–1983); CAREX (carcinogen exposure) project in the European Union (1990–1993)16; FINJEM (Finnish job-exposure matrix) system in Finland17; and the Canadian version of FINJEM.18 The most prevalent occupational lung carcinogens in high income countries over the past 30 years have been diesel exhaust, welding fumes, and silica. Based on data from Europe, Finland, and Canada, more than 2% of the employed population has been exposed to each of these three mixtures or agents. This proportion has not changed in the past three decades. Exposure to asbestos had been a dominant exposure in these countries, but its use declined markedly in recent decades due to widely accepted bans and restrictions. Asbestos exposure continues in these countries, however, due to large quantities of asbestos-containing materials still in place. For middle- and low-income countries, national estimates of the prevalence of exposure to occupational lung carcinogens have not been identified. Given the extent and lack of adequate regulation of manufacturing, mining, and construction, exposures to said agents is likely to be more common and at higher levels than in high income countries. For the purpose of lung cancer screening, workplace exposures that were prominent 20–40 years ago are highly relevant today due to the latency of asbestos-related lung cancer. Asbestos exposure was common in worksites in many high-income countries before the 1980s, though exposure in recent decades has declined. The prior and continuing high use of asbestos in China, Russia, India, and selected other countries is almost certainly associated with elevated risk of asbestos-related lung cancer for large populations of workers at, both at present and well into the future.19, 20 Other highly relevant exposures, such as silica, diesel exhaust, and welding fumes, were prevalent in the past and remain prevalent in countries of all national income levels. Salient industries and examples of occupations with current exposure to occupational lung carcinogens are provided in Table 2.21 Many construction workers are exposed to the most common lung carcinogens: asbestos, diesel exhaust, silica, and welding. Diesel engine exhaust exposure is highly prevalent among workers who drive or maintain diesel vehicles, including buses, trucks, trains, ships, and heavy equipment. Many workers in mining are exposed to diesel exhaust from mining equipment. Miners and workers in many manufacturing industries continue to have exposure to carcinogenic metals and silica. Metal fabricators, assemblers Metal processors, shaping workers Clay, stone, glass processors Forging workers Boilermakers, platers Silica, diesel exhaust, painting, welding, coal-tar pitch, asbestos Outdoor air pollution Excavators Welders Painters Plumbers Other construction Bus drivers Truck drivers Mechanical maintenance Drillers, blasters Miners, quarry workers Mineral ore treaters Occupation and, more generally, social class, are closely associated with cigarette smoking. In the United States, one-quarter or more of workers in construction, manufacturing, mining, and transportation smoke cigarettes compared to 10% of workers in professional or managerial positions.22 In China, for example, the prevalence of smoking among male machine operators (67%) was nearly twice that of male medical/health personnel or teaching staff (36%–38%).23 It is well-established that occupational lung carcinogens and cigarette smoke act in concert in some circumstances to increase the risk of lung cancer. They share mechanistic pathways and have been repeatedly shown in epidemiologic studies to increase lung cancer risk above that expected by the presence of each risk factor alone. Asbestos is the best-known example of this phenomenon. Asbestos frequently shows at least a supra-additive interaction with smoking in determining lung cancer risk.24-28 Several large studies addressing the lung cancer risk among silica-exposed workers have been completed in the past decade, generally suggesting a supra-additive effect with cigarette smoke.29-33 Other occupational lung carcinogens that have been studied for interaction include diesel exhaust34, 35; and radon.36-38 Occupational exposures also indirectly increase lung cancer risk by causing chronic lung diseases, namely, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and pneumoconioses, such as silicosis and asbestosis.21, 39 In fact, since occupational exposures to vapors, gases, dusts, or fumes raise the risk of COPD,40 for example, the occupational contribution to lung cancer should be considered more broadly than simply the role of the occupational agents causing lung cancer. Smoking works similarly as a major cause of COPD and as an established risk factor for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.41, 42 Figure 1 illustrates the complexity of these relationships. Key aspects of these relationships have been well-studied (e.g., the smoking and asbestos interaction noted above and the contribution of asbestosis and silicosis to risk of lung cancer). Other relationships, such as the interaction between work-related COPD and lung cancer, have received relatively less attention. Three decades of research provide strong evidence that periodic low dose chest CT scans can identify lung cancers at an early stage and can reduce lung cancer mortality. In Japan and the United States, Sone et al.43 and Henschke et al.44 separately demonstrated that low dose chest CT scanning in high risk populations detected ~85% of lung cancers at Stage I. In 2006, Henschke and colleagues further showed that treated early CT-detected lung cancers had excellent survival: a group of 412 Stage 1 lung cancers detected by CT screening had an estimated 88% 10-year survival.45 Of those who underwent surgical resection within 1 month of diagnosis, 10-year survival was 92%, 95% CI 88–95%. These remarkable results of nonrandomized studies stimulated intense interest and the initiation of randomized controlled trials of the impact of low dose CT scans on lung cancer mortality. Two large complementary randomized clinical trials of populations at high risk of lung cancer—the US National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) and the Dutch–Belgian Nederlands–Leuvens Longkanker Screenings Onderzoek (NELSON)—conclusively demonstrated that periodic low dose chest CT scanning reduces lung cancer mortality.46, 47 The NLST, conducted by the United States National Cancer Institute, included 53,454 enrollees aged 55–74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years and, for former smokers, had quit within the past 15 years. The CT versus chest X-ray (CXR) study arms were screened annually for 5 years and followed for a median of 6.5 years. The CT scan screening arm showed a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality versus the CXR screening arm.46 The NELSON trial included 13,195 men and 2594 women aged 50–74 years who had smoked at least 15–20 pack-years and, if former smokers, had quit 10 or fewer years before the entry date into the study. NELSON compared an intervention group who underwent four rounds of CT screening (baseline, year 1, year 3, and year 5.5) with a reference group who had no screening; all were followed for at least 10 years. NELSON observed a 24% and 33% lung cancer mortality reduction among men and women, respectively, in the trial.47 Neither the NLST nor the NELSON trials were designed to evaluate the efficacy of lung cancer among screenees defined other than by age and smoking. Other factors would include occupational exposures, chronic lung disease, family history of lung cancer, personal history of cancer, or environmental exposure to radon, air pollution, or other nonoccupational toxins. An alternative to the use of age and smoking history alone to estimate lung cancer risk and to determine screening eligibility is the employment of a broader set of lung cancer risk factors in lung cancer risk models. More than 20 lung cancer risk prediction models based on large lung cancer data sets (e.g., prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancer screening trial [PLCO, developed in North America]48; liverpool lung project [LLP, developed in England]49) have been developed, and many are inclusive of a broader and more detailed set of lung cancer risk factors than the NLST and NELSON trials.50 These additional risk factors variably include gender, race, body mass index (BMI), intensity and duration of smoking, number of years since smoking cessation, chronic lung disease, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), personal history of cancer, family history of lung cancer, education, and asbestos exposure. Among the better-performing models, the only occupational carcinogen included is asbestos, which is part of the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) and Bach models.49, 51 No other occupational or environmental exposures have been included in the risk prediction models. Lung cancer risk calculators derived from these models use no or little information about occupation in determining risk. In a noteworthy comparison of the risk factor versus risk prediction approaches to the use of LDCT, ten Haaf52 applied nine established lung cancer risk prediction models to the large data sets of the NLST and the PLCO and compared results to the risk factor eligibility criteria used in the NLST, using 5- and 6-year lung cancer incidence and mortality as outcomes. The specificity of the risk prediction models versus the NLST criteria were very similar (~62.2%–62.6%), but four models had substantially higher levels of sensitivity (>78%) compared to that of the NLST criteria (71.4%) with respect to lung cancer incidence. The contrast in sensitivity for lung cancer mortality between the NLST criteria and the model predictions was even greater: 73.5% for the NLST versus 85.2% for the PLCOm2012 model and 83.8% for the two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) and Bach models.52 In a US National Cancer Institute study of this issue, investigators compared the lung cancer mortality benefits of a risk prediction-based model versus a USPSTF guidelines-based model (restricted to age and smoking) and concluded that the former approach, which used family history, self-reported emphysema, body mass index, age, and a broader range of smoking history as eligibility criteria, prevented a greater number of lung cancer deaths than a model based on USPSTF screening guidelines (see below).53, 54 Based principally on the results of the NLST, the United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) recommended in 2013 that annual low dose CT scanning be offered to individuals at high risk of lung cancer, who were defined as people aged 55–74 years who had smoked at least 30 pack-years of cigarettes and currently smoke or quit less than 15 years previously. In 2021, after publication of the NELSON trial results, the USPSTF revised its recommendations for annual LDCT eligibility to include people aged 50–80 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years.55 These recommendations were adopted by the US federal government and private insurance companies for use in health insurance coverage and clinical preventive practice. Recommendations based in Europe to date have adopted a more heterogeneous approach. In a March 2022 report prepared by Science Advice for Policy by European Academies (SAPEA), a consortium effort of European Scientific Academies and released, lung cancer screening with LDCT is recommended, using either a combination of age and smoking or the PLCOm2012 model.56 An expert group of European physicians and scientists who are leaders in lung cancer screening in Europe have developed a set of consensus recommendations on lung cancer screening, which were published in June 2020.57 They recommended the use of lung cancer risk thresholds (e.g., 1.51% over a 6-year period) applied to results of risk prediction models to determine who should be eligible for LDCT-based lung cancer screening. Of the numerous risk prediction models that have been developed, the expert group favored those derived from the Liverpool Lung Project (LLPv2) and the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCOm2012). In China, a multidisciplinary lung cancer early detection and treatment expert group (appointed by the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission) established the China National Lung Cancer Screening Guidelines, recommending annual lung cancer screening with LDCT for people aged 50–74 years who have at least a 20 pack-year smoking history and who currently smoke or have quit within the past 5 years.58 The latest Chinese guidelines developed by the National Cancer Center of China recommends lung cancer screening eligibility including: (1) current smokers with ≥30 pack-years or former smokers with ≥30 pack-years who have quit within 15 years; (2) secondhand smokers who have lived or worked with smokers for at least 20 years; (3) people with COPD; (4) participants who have exposure ≥1 year to asbestos, radon, beryllium, chromium, cadmium, nickel, silica, or soot; (5) people with first degree relatives have confirmed lung cancer.59 The South African Thoracic Society recently issued recommended guidelines for lung cancer screening. They recommend that annual LDCT should be offered to people between 55 and 74 years of age who are current or former smokers (having quit less than 15 years previously) with a history of ≥30-pack years of smoking. Participants should have no history of lung cancer and be in reasonable health and able and willing to be treated for lung cancer. They note that the high prevalence of tuberculosis in South Africa requires that only lung nodules ≥6 mm need follow-up.60 Occupation is generally ignored in current screening recommendations, whether they are based on selected risk factors (age and smoking) or on risk prediction models. Exceptions in the US include guidelines developed by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) and the American Society of Thoracic Surgeons. Their guidelines include using additional risk factors to determine screening eligibility, that is, family history, history of chronic lung disease and occupational exposures. Specifically, NCCN Group 2 eligibility criteria, first used in 2014, recommended screening people aged ≥50 years with a 20 pack-year smoking history if they have an additional risk factor for lung cancer, such as exposure to occupational lung carcinogens, chronic lung disease, or a family history of lung cancer and had an aggregate 6 year risk of lung cancer ≥1.3%.61 More recently, NCCN recommended a 20 pack-year screening threshold for everyone aged 50 years and over but occupation and other risk factors can additionally be considered in determining eligibility for screening.62 Occupational lung carcinogens named include silica, cadmium, asbestos, arsenic, beryllium, chromium, diesel exhaust, nickel, coal smoke, and soot. In 2014, a group of international experts in asbestos-related diseases met in Helsinki and recommended that the lung cancer risk level associated with the NLST study population be used as the threshold risk level in organized low dose CT scan programs for screening asbestos-exposed workers for lung cancer.63 The Helsinki recommendation was made before completion of the NELSON clinical trial, numerous modeling studies, and revision of the USPSTF eligibility guidelines in 2021. In 2017, an expert working group in France made recommendations for the application of LDCT for lung cancer screening for workers who have a history of exposure to Group 1 IARC occupational lung carcinogens, including asbestos.64 They conducted a scientific literature review and developed an expert consensus on how to identify the magnitude of lung cancer risks associated with these Group 1 carcinogens, alone and in combination with cigarette smoking, and identified the combinations that equaled or exceeded the lung cancer risk associated with NLST eligibility criteria. They assumed a multiplicative (and not a supra-additive or additive) joint effect between the occupational carcinogenic agent and tobacco in estimating the relative risks. They estimated that the relative risk of lung cancer associated with the NLST study eligibility criteria (≥30 pack-year history of cigarette smoking) was 30. Using the target relative risk level of 30, exposure to each of the IARC Group 1 lung carcinogens in combination with 20–29 pack years of smoking met or exceeded the target risk level. Never smokers who were occupationally exposed to lung carcinogens at any level did not reach a relative risk sufficient to justify lung cancer screening with the possible exceptions of plutonium and bis-chloromethyl ether.64 Since the publication of this set of French recommendations in 2017, the results of the NELSON trial and modeling studies led the USPSTF to lower the age and smoking levels for eligibility for LDCT-based lung cancer screening (≥age 50 years and ≥20 pack-years). The associated estimated relative risk level of lung cancer in the French analysis would be 20. Accordingly, under these French guidelines, workers with intermediate asbestos exposure ≥10 years and workers with ≤5 years of high asbestos exposure would be recommended for lung cancer screening even among ever smokers with a smoking history of less than 20 pack-years. Studies of lung cancer screening among occupational populations at high risk of lung cancer are limited to date. Two types of occupational settings have been studied: asbestos-exposed groups and US nuclear weapons workers. Nine nonrandomized studies of asbestos-exposed populations with ≥150 participants reported results of LDCT screening for lung cancer between 2002 and 2019.65-74 Age, smoking history, and asbestos exposure were principal or exclusive eligibility criteria with frequent use of broader age and smoking ranges than those used in NLST or NELSON. These studies were included in a published systematic review and meta-analyses by Ollier et al.75 and Maisonneuve et al.73 None of these studies used risk prediction models, NLST, or NELSON eligibility criteria to determine eligibility. Comparison with NLST or the NELSON results is precluded by the heterogeneity of the study populations and the lack of sufficient detail on smoking history and age in the published studies. Combining the screening yield results of these nine studies yielded 86 lung cancers detected among 5548 ever smokers (1.55%) and 6 lung cancers detected among 1787 never smokers (0.33%). Parameters of asbestos exposure varied widely among the nine studies by industry, occupation, duration of em",0271-3586 1097-0274,-1,openalex,1645,,,,195

Occupational exposures are another important risk factor, with an estimated population attributable fraction up to 15%. Objectives This study aimed at assessing the effect of occupational exposures on lung cancer mortality in Switzerland after adjustment for non-occupational lung carcinogens. Methods We used negative binomial regression to analyse data of 4,351,383 Swiss residents with available occupation, and assess its effect on lung cancer mortality between 1990 and 2014, accounting for socio-demographic factors, smoking probabilities (by age, geographical region, civil status, educational level, nationality, and occupation) and measured environmental exposure to radon. Results Male machine operators and workers in mining, stone working and building materials manufacturing showed the highest risk with a relative risk (RR) of 2.42 (95%-IC: 2.05-2.87) and 2.08 (95%-IC: 1.50-2.89) compared to health occupations, respectively. In women, two of the largest risks were identified in electronics, watchmaking, vehicle construction and toolmaking (RR: 2.33 (95%-IC: 1.75-3.10)) and transport and traffic occupations (RR: 2.23 (95%-IC: 1.75-2.83)). Smoking RRs were 1.33 (95%-IC: 1.27-1.38) in males and 1.37 (95%-IC: 1.26-1.48) in females, while radon related RRs were not statically significant. Adjusting for socio-demographic factors, the RRs by occupation decreased by 16% and 4% on average in men and women, and by 4% and 6% when adjusting for smoking, but remained statistically significant. Conclusions The results suggest the presence of occupational exposures to lung carcinogens in addition to non-occupational factors.

Care Med,,Malignant and non-malignant findings from 5 years of low dose CT scans screening for lung cancer in the western Australian asbestos review program,,199,9,"Rationale Asbestos exposure raises the risk of lung cancer. With concurrent tobacco smoke exposure, the risk is more than additive but less than multiplicative. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for lung cancer screening reduce US Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF) requirement of >30 pack years exposure to >20 if there is additional occupational carcinogen exposure (in addition to aged 55-80 and <15yrs since quitting). We report the findings from the Western Australia Asbestos Review Program (ARP) low dose CT (LDCT) screening of asbestos-exposed individuals. Methods Between 2012-2017 annual LDCT chest scans were offered to ARP participants (≥3 months cumulative asbestos exposure, regardless of tobacco exposure). In addition, health questionnaires (including smoking status) were performed. An indeterminate nodule was defined as being >5mm and/or >50mm3. The outcomes of nodules, asbestos-related pleural disease and other incidental findings were analysed. The Brock model was used to calculate lung cancer risk in prevalent nodules. Results 1743 individuals (262 (15.0%) female) with a median (IQR) age of 69.8 (63.0-75.7) years underwent 5702 screening scans. 610 (35%) had CT features of asbestosis and (62%) had pleural plaque. 595 (34.1%) were never smokers, 131 (7.5%) were current smokers. Median pack year history was 17.1 (7.2-33.8). 236 (13.5%) individuals fitted USPSTF criteria and 258 (14.8%) NCCN criteria. 187 (10.7%) individuals had at least one nodule, 148 of these were prevalent nodules and 51 were incident (25.6%). 16 individuals had multiple nodules. Of these individuals with nodules, 61 (32.6%) had never smoked. Of the smokers, median exposure was 19.0 pack years. Median lung cancer risk of the nodules was 1.8% (see Figure 1 for density of risk). Lung cancer was confirmed in 18 (1.0% of total cohort). Just 3 of those with lung cancer would have been eligible for screening under USPSTF or NCCN criteria. Incidental findings included 28 with suspicious pleural thickening, 7 diagnosed with mesothelioma, 30 had parenchymal inflammatory changes that resolved on subsequent imaging. 9 had significant vascular or cardiac abnormalities that required further evaluation. Median effective radiation dose was 0.2 mSv. Conclusion This asbestos-exposed cohort has a lung cancer rate comparable to other high-risk smoking cohorts, despite modest tobacco exposure. Existing lung cancer screening recruitment models may not adequately account for the risk from asbestos exposure.

Smoking, genetic factors and other prevalent diseases only partly explain IPF, and so this review aims to summarize recent progress in establishing which occupational exposures are important in cause.Recent findingsIPF is a rare disease, although it is the commonest idiopathic interstitial pneumonia. Epidemiological study suggests that incidence of IPF is increasing, particularly in older men. There are significant associations with IPF and occupational exposures to organic dust, including livestock, birds and animal feed, metal dust, wood dust and silica/minerals. Estimates of effect vary between studies, and are influenced by the distribution of employment, study design and case definition. Inhalation of asbestos fibres is a known cause of usual interstitial pneumonia (as seen histologically in IPF), though there are significant linear relationships between asbestos consumption, and mortality from both IPF and mesothelioma, leading to the hypothesis that low-level asbestos exposure may cause IPF.SummaryResearch must focus on exposure-response relationships between asbestos and other occupational inhaled hazards, and IPF.

Stewart",2016,International Journal of Cancer,10.1002/ijc.30009,How do we judge what causes cancer? the meat controversy,2309-2311,138,10,"The fact that obesity and the intake of processed meat are considered ""carcinogenic to humans"" – according to the criteria used by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and/or the World Cancer Research Fund (WCRF) – may look disconcerting to many, and calls for an explanation of how the conception of causality has developed in medicine in the last 50 years. In this evolution IARC itself has played a pivotal role, as testified by the recent publication of a volume on its history1, and the long series of Monographs on the carcinogenicity of specified agents to humans2. The gold standard of causality in medicine since the 1940s has been the randomized clinical trial (RCT), used to test pharmaceutical drugs and other interventions intended to be beneficial. The emphasis of RCTs is on single agents as causal factors (medical treatments or otherwise ""actionable"" agents). This can be aligned with the microbiological tradition, in particular the criteria for the identification of pathogenic micro-organisms developed by Henle and Koch in the 18th and 19th centuries. According to these criteria, an agent was a cause of disease if it was always present in the diseased individuals, it was always absent in the healthy subjects and the disease could be reproduced by inoculation in animals. The first RCTs were on antibiotics, i.e. antimicrobial agents, to affirm the relationship between the successes of microbiology and the development of a powerful strategy to investigate drugs. Also the early years of research on chemical carcinogenesis entertained the idea of most cancer cases being attributable to single causal agents. That was, however, abandoned already in the 1950s mainly due to epidemiological studies demonstrating then-inexplicable marked differences in cancer incidence between communities worldwide. The idea of a single causal agent, applicable perhaps to smoking and a few like agents, may still be at the heart of community thinking about cancer causation generally, and may be at the basis of recent misunderstandings concerning the classification of processed meat. When tobacco smoking was found to be carcinogenic by sound epidemiological research in the 1950s, the tobacco industry asked for more than evidence of an association, specifying RCTs as the gold standard. Of course RCTs could not be undertaken for ethical reasons (we cannot knowingly expose humans to putative hazardous agents). To develop a sound response to this claim from the tobacco industry, the English statistician Sir Austin Bradford Hill modified Henle-Koch's criteria to apply them to non-infectious diseases such as cancer. The guidelines developed by Bradford Hill - and used in a modified version also in the US Surgeon General reports on tobacco smoking – date back to the English philosophy of science developed in particular by John Stuart Mill and founded on concepts such as consistency of observations in different populations, strength of the statistical association between exposure and risk of disease, the presence of a quantitative relationship between level of exposure and quantification of the risk and the biological plausibility of a causal association (based for example on knowledge of intermediate mechanisms or work in animals and in vitro systems). It is with similar criteria that IARC Working Groups have come to the conclusion that chemicals or other exposures are ""carcinogenic to humans"". While for many of these the causal nature of the association with cancer is obvious because of the strong increase in risk, for example asbestos and mesothelioma or aromatic amines and bladder cancer, for other exposures the conclusions of IARC have been more controversial, usually showing that the critics have little understanding of current concepts of causality in medicine. One of the Henle-Koch's criteria was the idea of necessary cause, meaning that the disease will not appear in those unexposed to the agent in question: for example, the Ebola virus is necessary to develop the disease known as Ebola. However, the public usually does not appreciate that cancer and other non-infectious diseases are often due to a combination of factors, none of which is sufficient nor necessary. Cancer is multifactorial, that is it arises because exposure to several agents together with certain biological processes (including for example DNA damage or cell proliferation as explained below) constitute a pathway leading to malignancy. Multiple agents are involved almost by definition. Being obese or eating red meat do not necessarily lead to cancer, and in fact the causal association with cancer is weak (meaning a mathematically small increase in risk) but well established. We know only one necessary cause for cancer (i.e. an agent without which a certain type of cancer would not occur), that not by chance is an infectious agent, human papilloma virus (HPV) for cervical cancer (in this particular case we also have the equivalent of RCT evidence through vaccination). For non-infectious diseases, the vast majority of known causal agents belong to the category of non-necessary causes, such as tobacco smoking, asbestos, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and so on. Thus everyone is aware when a lifelong never smoker is diagnosed with lung cancer. Just to give some figures, the lifetime risk of lung cancer in a non-smoker is 1% and in a heavy smoker it is 25%; the lifetime risk of myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular diseases in people without other risk factors but with a cholesterol/HDL ratio greater than 6 is 19%, compared to 16% in those with a normal ratio (up to the age of 75); the risk of colorectal cancer in frequent red meat eaters is 6% vs. 5% in moderate eaters. Following the historical evolution described above, cancer causation is now understood as the complex interplay of numerous agents and biological response patterns that act along distinct mechanistic pathways, thus creating the opportunity for several steps critical to the carcinogenic process to be affected. Also ""weak"" risk factors, i.e. those for which the evidence of causal association with cancer is clear but the increase in risk is 20-50% rather than 10-fold (or 100-500-fold like for HPV), can contribute to the process if they are in combination with other agents. This is the case for example of processed meat, that increases the risk of colorectal cancer by 18% for every 50 grams of intake per day (that gives the difference between 5% and 6% reported above). This is well established, but the absolute increase in risk is low. The public (and the media) should be sufficiently informed as to recognize the difference between degree of evidence (strong for processed meat) and strength of the risk increase (modest for 50 grams of processed meat per day). This concept is well-known in clinical practice: response to therapies is much more complex than we thought 50 years ago (when antibiotics dramatically saved lives), and response of patients depends upon pathways and networks that include co-morbidities and individual susceptibility. Therefore, a drug can definitely improve survival or well-being (the evidence may be strong) only in some – but not all – patients. Thus, in both etiologic (ie. causation-based) research and clinical medicine we acknowledge that an occurrence in a single patient can be due to the concomitant action of several component ""causes"" within a causal complex. A direct and immediate overlap between recognized causes of cancer and single agents identified as carcinogens is challenged by current understanding of cancer causation. Complex exposures or behaviours can be recognized as posing a carcinogenic risk in the absence of the isolation of the single specific causal agent. The IARC Monograph evaluations have addressed circumstances of exposure in which the discrete carcinogenic agent(s) have not been identified, a situation exemplified by occupational exposure as a painter. The WCRF specifies that, for example, 'The evidence that greater body fatness is a cause of colorectal cancer is convincing': a cause of cancer identified in the absence of any reference to a relevant carcinogen(s). Only a proportion of persons exposed to a given level of carcinogen for a specified period develop cancer, corresponding to the concept that single carcinogens are usually ""insufficient ""causes. Similarly, with some exceptions, only a proportion of patients respond to a drug otherwise recognized as effective. Reasons for such circumstances are largely unknown, but include variation in biological susceptibility and more broadly defined characteristics including socio-economic status and race, in addition to the impact of other carcinogenic exposures. Considered in relation to the sequence of events leading to cancer development, genetic determination of susceptibility may be characterized as operating prior to carcinogen exposure. Epidemiology is currently based on a model, popularized by Kenneth Rothman's use of ""pie"" diagrams to illustrate sufficient causal complexes resulting from individual insufficient components3. For example, lung cancer in an individual may be explained by a ""pie"" made of smoking, plus past exposure to asbestos plus inherited susceptibility related to variants in DNA repair genes: none of these is sufficient in itself but their complex can in fact be sufficient to cause cancer in a single individual. No single component is generally necessary, i.e. it will not be found in all causal complexes (pies); but it is necessary in the single ""pie"" insofar as its elimination will make that complex ineffective and thus prevent disease in that particular individual. In this context it is clear that also ""weak"" risk factors can be recognized as contributing causes. Consideration of biological responses ('mechanisms') provoked by agents specified as causing cancer in humans, that is Group 1 agents in the IARC Monographs parlance, indicates a range of parameters encompassing, but well beyond, the widespread recognition of DNA-damaging carcinogens. They include the ability of an agent to: (1) be metabolized or broken down to a reactive intermediate; (2) damage DNA; (3) alter DNA repair or increase the occurrence of mutations; (4) induce heritable alterations apart from mutations; (5) induce oxidative stress; (6) induce chronic inflammation; (7) be immunosuppressive; (8) modulate endocrine-related pathways; (9) cause cells to divide indefinitely rather than for a finite number of times; and (10) alter cell proliferation, cell death, or nutrient supply4. Many, but not all of these characteristics involve patterns of response able to be identified with reference to a single cell. The mechanisms by which obesity is thought to mediate cancer development involve multi-cellular or tissue-based processes: perturbation of sex hormone metabolism, of insulin and related intra-cellular signaling, and effects due to hormone-like pathophysiology and inflammation. In the case of red meat there is evidence of genotoxic activity of carcinogens formed during cooking practices (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic aromatic amines) or via the reaction of heme iron with nitrite (sometimes generated from nitrate) to form nitroso compounds; but also others among the mechanisms listed above are at work. The difference between single agents able to act on single cells, perhaps through a relatively simple pathway perturbation, and exposures such as obesity - that act indirectly via a number of multicellular pathways - explains why it has been easier to establish the carcinogenicity of single agents in the past. Knowing that a particular tumour type is caused by a specified carcinogen immediately reveals the potential for cancer prevention. From a global perspective, the highest priorities for cancer prevention are known: tobacco control, eliminating infection by hepatitis B and HPV, reversing trends in overweight/obesity and sedentary lifestyle, drinking less alcohol, and avoiding exposure to occupational and polluting carcinogens. Some, but not all of these measures involve exposure to an agent readily identified as a carcinogen. The decreasing incidence of lung cancer in many high-income countries epitomizes the relevance and centrality of cancer epidemiology to cancer control: an outcome achieved despite the intransigence of the tobacco industry. The identification of tobacco smoke as carcinogenic to humans ultimately encompassed both mechanistic data and epidemiological data including the decline in lung cancer after smoking cessation as well as lung cancer attributable to second hand smoke. Though understood to be a modifiable risk factor, consideration of obesity or red meat in this context clearly indicates greater complexity compared to occupational carcinogens or tobacco. The causal association of obesity with cancer at several sites is established unequivocally and the implicit preventive potential is recognized as a public health imperative. The inter-related risk factors of high caloric diet, overweight/obesity and physical inactivity intuitively suggest cancer prevention through dietary modification, weight control and exercise. If relevant change can be achieved, reduced cancer rates may be anticipated or implied as a matter of common sense. In fact, evidence for the efficacy of measures such as dietary change, albeit with reference to trial-based populations, is becoming available. For example, adoption of the Mediterranean diet has contributed to the primary prevention of breast cancer in some studies. In the case of red meat, two RCTs exemplify intervention: the Women's Health Initiative and the Polyp Prevention Trial (PPT, focused on polyp recurrence as outcome).5, 6 In the first a reduction in meat intake was included in more complex dietary and behavioural changes, so that meat intake as such cannot easily be evaluated. In PPT the reduction of processed meat intake in the course of the intervention was low for processed meat, and the follow-up was only 4 years. Telling people what causes cancer and how to avoid it is not only a public health imperative; the information is often identified with a 'right to know'. Concerning the disease which is feared most, the community demands to be informed, relying in large part on relevant statutory authorities and trusted non-government agencies. Media reports about risk of cancer causation, commonly characterized as 'cancer scares', usually involve the potential for exposure to a recognized carcinogen(s) through its presence in food or a consumer product. Reporting of such exposure, and an implied risk of cancer, can be justified by reference to the principle summarized as 'no safe level of exposure to a known carcinogen'. There is however confusion about the degree of evidence available, the strength of association with risk (""strong"" and ""weak"" carcinogens), and between single carcinogenic agents and complex exposures and behaviours. Some causes of cancer, such as smoking or exposure to asbestos, are easily recognized. Others not clearly supported by scientific evidence, such as stress or pesticide residues in food, may be accorded recognition by the media ahead of, for example, obesity and alcohol drinking. In relation to single chemical carcinogens, widespread understanding of 'no safe dose' serves the community well, particularly when necessary distinction is made between regulations preventing exposure to certain carcinogens at low level and lifestyle changes warranted to prevent an evident burden of cancer. In the case of complex exposures and behaviours such as obesity or meat intake, the degree of evidence is strong but they cannot be treated as single carcinogens are, for example because the concept of ""no safe dose"" cannot be used for them. Though prevention is certainly necessary for these, translation of science into regulation is much more complex. We believe that the current procedures used by IARC are scientifically sound. However, a very clear distinction should be made between a ""carcinogen"", that entails ""no safe dose"" and agents or behaviours that are ""causes of cancer"" such as obesity or red meat, where the concept of no safe dose is meaningless and the evaluations of carcinogenicity need to be put in context. These complex issues may be addressed when the Monograph Preamble, which specifies procedure and terminology, is next revised. ",0020-7136 1097-0215,-1,openalex,1610,,,,201

In addition, case-referent studies of patients with lung cancer show an attributable risk for asbestos of 6% to 23%, which is much higher than the actual occurrence of asbestosis among these patients.

Although more stringent control of asbestos in the workplace and decreasing industrial use has contributed to declines in the prevalence of asbestosis in the United States (1), new cases continue to be identified. Similarly, silicosis is seen among sandblasters, underground miners, foundry and quarry workers, and in other dust-exposed trades (2). Both diseases, which may have relatively long latency periods, are observed in the clinic today, usually as a result of high occupational exposures in the past, and they are problematic in that treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants, the usual approaches to therapy for fibrotic lung disease, is ineffective (3). Asbestos and silica are complex, naturally occurring minerals that are chemically and physically distinct. Moreover, the pathology of asbestosis and silcosis is dissimilar. However, the pathogenesis of these lesions and the major changes in pulmonary architecture, namely, the laying down of collagen in an interstitial location, appear to be similar to many of the features seen in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Like IPF and representative animal models of IPF such as bleomycin instillation (4), both asbestosis and silicosis are characterized by a persistent inflammatory response and generation of proinflammatory and profibrotic mediators. Although asbestosis and silicosis have been studied intensely by basic and clinical research scientists, little is known about the crucial cellular mechanisms that initiate and drive the processes of inflammation and fibrogenesis. Many laboratories have developed animal and in vitro models of asbestosis and silicosis to elucidate the cellular events and properties of minerals important in disease causation. Others have explored confounding factors contributing to particulate-induced cell injury as well as cellular and molecular defense mechanisms in response to these minerals. This information has been used to modulate inflammation and fibrosis in expermental animal models in attempts to develop more effective treatment regimens for pulmonary fibroses. This review will briefly address the clinical and pathologic features of asbestosis and silicosis, and consider the mineralogic features of asbestos and silica that may be important in disease causation along with confounding factors such as coexposures to smoking and/or other mineral dusts. The relationship of particle number, type, and size to disease patterns will be reviewed. We will then summarize data published within the past 5 yr on cellular and molecular mechanisms of asbestosis and silicosis and preventive approaches to these diseases in experimental animal models.

However, further studies showed that carcinogenicity occurred only under conditions that resulted in impaired lung clearance ('overloading') leading to inflammatory reactions and other pathologic sequelae. These observations together with the findings that carbon black, a model for diesel particles devoid of organic mutagens and carcinogens, also induced lung cancers under conditions of overloading led to the suggestion that the cancers resulted from a non-genotoxic mechanism. However, the further finding that inert particulate carcinogens devoid of organics, induce mutations has led to a re-evaluation of the role of mutations in lung carcinogenesis caused by particles and the relevance of the rat model to humans. This is especially timely as epidemiological studies suggest that humans may develop lung cancers following occupational exposure to diesel emission by a mechanism unlikely to involve lung overloading. Finally, the recent recognition that environmental PM-10 (respiratory size particles) may be responsible for a significant portion of human morbidity and mortality, ensures that the health effect of diesel emissions will continue to receive scrutiny as they contribute to the PM-10 load.",0027-5107,-1,"pubmed, embase","1435, 1224",,,,204

Lung cancer consists of several cell types instead of a single cell type. Different cell types are preferentially located in different parts of the bronchial tree. There is no single method that can detect pre-invasive cancer in the entire bronchial epithelium and allow simultaneous tissue sampling for pathological diagnosis and molecular profiling. While computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasound can detect objects in the sub-milliliter scale, photonic imaging can detect structural and functional changes in cells and tissues down to the micron and sub-micron range. It is therefore advantageous to use light to detect pre-invasive lung caner and preneoplastic lesions that are usually very thin and small. When tissue is illuminated by light, the light can be absorbed, scattered, induce fluorescence or vibration changes. Significant differences in reflectance and autofluorescence properties have been observed between normal, pre-malignant and malignant tissues. These differences in optical properties have been exploited to enhance the detection rate of high-grade bronchial dysplasia and carcinoma in-situ. Current commercially available autofluorescence bronchoscopy devices make use of a combination of autofluorescence and reflectance. A blue or violet light is used to induce tissue autofluorescence. The fluorescence image is then combined with a blue, red and/or green reflectance image for display. In addition to multiple single center studies, there are 3 multi-center clinical trials and two randomized trials that showed improved detection rate with fluorescence bronchoscopy or with fluorescence-reflectance bronchoscopy compared to white-light bronchosocpy alone. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy has the advantage that a biopsy can be taken during the same examination for pathological confirmation. For cancer beyond the range of the bronchoscope, gene expression analysis of bronchial brush cells holds promise to differentiate between malignant versus benign peripheral lung nodules. Autofluorescence bronchoscopy has contributed to improved histopathological classification and molecular profiling of preneoplastic lesions. It has become an integral part of a standard bronchoscopic examination for lung cancer diagnosis. False-positive fluorescence can occur due to inflammation or conditions that increase vascularity of the bronchial mucosa. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can overcome this problem by allowing visualization of the sup-epithelial layers. The principle of OCT is similar to ultrasound. Instead of using sound, infrared light is used. Back-scattered light from varying tissue depths can be used to delineate cellular and extra-cellular structures. Doppler OCT can add further information on vascular density and blood flow. Recent studies showed that high-grade dysplasia, carcinoma in-situ and invasive cancer can be distinguished from normal, hyperplastic or metaplastic epithelium. Interruption of the basement membrane would indicate the presence of invasive cancer. Areas of inflammation also show distinctive changes. Since small preneoplastic lesions can be removed by a biopsy procedure, OCT holds promise as a non-biopsy tool to study the natural history of preneoplastic lesions and the effect of chemoprevention. In the context of an early lung cancer detection program, approximately 18% of cancers - majority of which being Stage 0 caners, are detected by fluorescence bronchoscopy alone with a negative spiral CT. Lung cancer risk assessment models using biometric data such as family history, presence or absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, family history of lung cancer and body mass index in addition to age, smoking history and occupational exposure are being validated. These models have the potential to predict the risk of lung cancer development better than the Gail model for breast cancer. Prospective clinical trials need to be performed to validate the use of these lung cancer risk models to select individuals at highest risk of developing lung cancer for intensive screening utilizing both fluorescence-reflectance bronchoscopy and spiral CT to detect early cancer in both the central and peripheral airways that are amendable to curative therapies.",1556-0864 1556-1380,-1,openalex,1756,,,,206

450,1620,,2006,,10.26616/nioshpub2006123,Criteria for a recommended standard: occupational exposure to refractory ceramic fibers.,-,,,"When the U.S. Congress passed the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Public Law 91-596), it established the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).Through the Act, Congress charged NIOSH with recommending occupational safety and health standards and describing exposure limits that are safe for various periods of employment.These limits include but are not limited to the exposures at which no worker will suffer diminished health, functional capacity, or life expectancy as a result of his or her work experience.By means of criteria documents, NIOSH communicates these recommended standards to regulatory agencies (including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration [OSHA]), health professionals in academic institutions, industry, organized labor, public interest groups, and others in the occupational safety and health community.Criteria documents contain a critical review of the scientific and technical information about the prevalence of hazards, the existence of safety and health risks, and the adequacy of control methods.This criteria document is derived from reviews of information from human and animal studies of the toxicity of refractory ceramic fibers (RCFs) and is intended to describe the potential health effects of occupational exposure to airborne fibers of this material.RCFs are amorphous synthetic fibers produced by the melting and blowing or spinning of calcined kaolin clay or a combination of alumina, silica, and other oxides.RCFs belong to the class of synthetic vitreous fibers (SVFs)-materials that also include fibers of glass wool, rock wool, slag wool, and specialty glass.RCFs are used in commercial applications requiring lightweight, high-heat insulation (e.g., furnace and kiln insulation).Commercial production of RCFs began in the 1950s in the United States, and production increased dramatically in the 1970s.Domestic production of RCFs in 1997 totaled approximately 107.7 million lb.Currently, total U.S. production has been estimated at 80 million lb per year, which constitutes 1% to 2% of SVFs produced worldwide.In the United States, approximately 31,500 workers have the potential for occupational exposure to RCFs during distribution, handling, installation, and removal.More than 800 of these workers are employed directly in the manufacturing of RCFs and RCF products.With increasing production of RCFs, concerns about exposures to airborne fibers prompted animal inhalation studies that have indicated an increased incidence of mesotheliomas in hamsters and lung cancer in rats following exposure to RCFs.Studies of workers who manufacture RCFs have shown a positive association between increased exposure to RCFs and the development of pleural plaques, skin and eye irritation, and respiratory symptoms and conditions (including dyspnea, wheezing, and chronic cough).In addition, current and former RCF production workers have shown decrements in pulmonary function.After evaluating this evidence, NIOSH proposes a recommended exposure limit (REL) for RCFs of 0.5 fiber per cubic centimeter (f/cm 3 ) of air as a time-weighted average (TWA) concentration for up to a 10-hr work shift during a 40-hr workweek.Limiting airborne RCF exposures to this concentration will minimize the risk for lung cancer and irritation of the eyes and upper Executive Summary vi Refractory Ceramic Fibers against lung cancer.However, given what is known from the animal and epidemiological data, NIOSH supports the intent of the PSP and concurs that a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 0.5 f/cm 3 as a TWA for up to a 10-hr work shift during a 40-hr workweek will lower the risk for developing lung cancer.Keeping exposures below the REL should reduce the risk of lung cancer to estimates between 0.073/1,000 and 1.2/1,000 (based on extrapolations of risk models from Moolgavkar et al. [1999] and Yu and Oberdörster [2000]).Keeping worker exposures below the REL will also reduce the risk of irritation of the eyes and upper respiratory system.",,-1,openalex,1620,,,,209

The parameter uncertainty/variability distributions used are essentially the same as the FORTRAN-based stochastic deposition model of Bolch et al. known as LUDUC (LUng Dose Uncertainty Code). Based on Crystal Ball software, this stochastic deposition model includes particle polydispersity, which Bolch et al. did not discuss. This paper first compares model-simulated regional deposition probability distributions to deterministic results based on LUDEP (LUng Dose Evaluation Program) software, which implements the ICRP 66 deterministic deposition model. For these comparisons, a particle density of 3 g cm-3 (for hypothetical radioactive particles) was used. The range of possible depositions generated by LUDUC and the Crystal Ball program results revealed LUDEP's limitations. Even though LUDEP tends to use parameters that represent average parameter values for adult males, it overestimates deposition in the lower regions of the lung for most of the population. The Crystal Ball program was then used to generate radioactivity intake distributions for single and multiple PuO2 particle intakes by a hypothetical population of nuclear workers for the stochastic intake (STI) paradigm. These distributions of radioactivity intake are evaluated for the five primary regions of the respiratory tract as defined in the ICRP Publication 66. The results reveal that when a particle has been deposited, the radioactivity is likely to be low if it is in the lower regions (< 10 Bq for the bb and AI regions), but it may be quite large in the upper regions (as much as 600 Bq for the ET1, and ET2 regions), and the distributions for radioactivity become less and less skewed to the right, as particles penetrate deeper within the respiratory tract.",0017-9078,-1,embase,1189,,,,210

58,1668,David Coggon,2001,Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health,10.5271/sjweh.606,Commentary,214-215,27,3,"Assessments of the burden of illness attributable to occupation are needed to plan the allocation of resources for disease prevention and research. In general, chemical, physical, and biological hazards in the workplace are easier to identify and control than those related to diet and life-style. Thus it is worth knowing whether modern work conditions have an important impact on health and, if so, where the major hazards lie. In this issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health , Nurminen & Karjalainen have attempted to estimate the proportion of deaths in Finland that is associated with occupational factors (1). They calculate that some 1800 deaths per year are work-related, most of them among men. This figure represents approximately 4% of all deaths nationally. Of course, some of the deaths attributed to work may also have been influenced by nonoccupational factors. For example, much of the excess mortality from lung cancer among workers exposed to asbestos could be avoided if the persons concerned did not smoke. Nevertheless, the figure of 4% is surprisingly high, and it is important to look carefully at the methods by which it was derived. As the authors acknowledge, their investigation inevitably entailed simplifications and a degree of informed guesswork. In some cases, such as the decision to ignore deaths from circulatory diseases after 75 years of age, the effect may have been to underestimate the contribution of occupation to mortality. Of greater concern, however, are biases that could have exaggerated the apparent impact of work. Two in particular deserve mention. First, the criteria by which diseases were accepted as a hazard of work were relatively undemanding as, for example, hydrocarbon solvents for cancers of the oral cavity and cervix, welding fumes for cancers of the pharynx and colon, styrene for cancer of the rectum, and extremely low-frequency electromagnetic fields for Alzheimer`s disease. Decisions to classify diseases as work-related appear to have been based largely on epidemiologic findings with little regard for the relevant biology. Thus there was no attempt to explain how inorganic dusts such as silica would give rise to cancer of the liver or why melanoma should be treated as a hazard of both indoor and outdoor work. Where exposures or associated causes of death are rare, the adoption of more stringent criteria for inclusion would have little impact on the overall calculation. However, for some causes of death, the effect is more important. For example, 10.3% of deaths from stomach cancer among men were attributed to farming and the rearing of livestock, hardly a well-established cause of the disease. The second problem arises from the dichotomous classification of exposures (present or absent) when, for almost all hazards, risk varies importantly according to the intensity and duration of exposure. For each hazard and disease, the starting point for the calculation of an attributable proportion was an estimate of the prevalence of exposure in the Finnish population and of the risk associated with that exposure. In some cases, risk estimates were derived from cohort studies. This procedure has the advantage that, in comparison with case-referent investigations, cohort studies tend to be less subject to bias and to selective reporting of positive results. However, it is usually the occupational populations with the highest exposures to a known or suspected hazard that are selected for investigation in cohort studies (because they are likely to be at greatest risk). Therefore, their risks cannot necessarily be extrapolated to other workers exposed at lower levels. Nurminen & Karjalainen were aware of this problem and state that they used cohort studies in which exposure levels were representative of those in the target populations to which the risk estimates were applied. However, they do not systematically provide the relative risks and exposure prevalences that their calculations assumed, and it is therefore difficult to judge how well this objective was achieved. An alternative approach, used for many of the hazards, is to derive risk estimates from case-referent studies based on the general population. Then, by definition, exposures should be more representative. On the other hand, risk estimates from case-referent studies may be inflated by biased recall of exposures, and nonpositive results may not find their way into the literature as completely as positive findings. In both cases, the effect will be to overestimate attributable proportions. For these reasons, the annual number of work-related deaths in Finland is unlikely to be as high as Nurminen & Karjalainen suggest. Nevertheless, their report is a useful starting point for further action. In particular, there is a need to focus more closely on the hazards that they propose carry the highest toll of mortality. These are the risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma from asbestos and of ischemic heart disease from shift work and noise. With regard to asbestos, the nature of the hazard and the relation of risk to exposure are well established. The challenge is to ensure that controls on exposure are properly applied, especially in the construction industry. The effects of shift work and noise on coronary heart disease are also potentially important, but further research is needed to confirm the scale of the problem and the underlying pathogenic mechanisms. Whether or not the impact of noise on mortality is as large as suggested, exposures should be controlled to prevent noise-induced hearing loss. However, preventive measures in relation to shift work are more difficult to specify without a better understanding of the precise aspects of shift work that influence risk. To provide a convincing basis for preventive action, controlled intervention studies may be needed.",0355-3140 1795-990X,-1,openalex,1668,,,,212

A French population-based sample with full job history (N = 10,010) was linked with four Matgéné job-exposure matrices: flour, cement, silica and benzene. LOEP and the 95% confidence interval were estimated using four methods: the maximum exposure probability during the career (Proba_max), two methods subdividing careers into job-periods (job-period_M1, job-period_M2) and one into job-years (job-year). To quantify differences between methods, percentages of variation were calculated for proportion values and PAF, and compared with published results for France using cross-sectional proportion multiplied by a factor. For each agent, LOEP estimated from the maximum probability during the career (Proba_max) was consistently lower than proportion taking account of job-periods or job-years. LOEP on Proba_max for flour, cement, silica and benzene were, respectively, 4.4% 95% CI (4.0-4.7), 4.3% (3.9-4.6), 6.1% (5.7-6.5) and 3.9% (3.6-4.2). Percentage of variation ranged from 0 to 55.8% according to the agent. The number of cancer cases varied by a twofold factor for exposure to silica and lung cancer and by a fourfold factor for exposure to benzene and acute myeloid lymphoma. The present study provides a description of several LOEP estimation methods based on exposure assessment over the entire career and describes their impact on PAF.

In addition, the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology is producing an ever-increasing array of high aspect ratio engineered nanomaterials [HARNs] with physical dimensions and biodurability similar to the asbestos fiber types with recognized pathogenic potential. Many of these non-asbestos/non-asbestiform EMPs and HARNs with the potential for aerosolization into the breathing zones of workers and in individuals in non-occupational environments have not yet been thoroughly studied with respect to their potential human pathogenicity, a fact which obviously poses concerns for both occupational health and public health professionals. On the basis of dose-response considerations it seems reasonable to infer that if any of these non-regulated EMPs or HARNs actually are pathogenic, then those mineral fiber exposure-induced disorders associated with the lowest cumulative exposure doses of the commercial amphibole types of asbestos, that is, diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura, and its non-malignant correlate of benign parietal pleural plaques, are those which are most likely to occur following inhalational exposures to any of the non-regulated EMPs and HARNs. Because of that observation, this paper reviews certain aspects of diffuse mesothelioma, including a summary of recent changes in the nomenclature of diffuse mesothelioma of the pleura; of both the descriptive and the analytical epidemiology of the disease; of the etiologies of mesothelioma, both ""exposure"" related and endogenous in nature; and of the asbestos population attributable fraction for diffuse mesotheliomas in the USA, both historically and in the future.",1096-0953,-1,"pubmed, embase","1297, 1010",,,,216

432,1780,Richard A. Rettig,1995,Health Affairs,10.1377/hlthaff.14.4.309,Choosing Sides In The War On Cancer,309-311,14,4,"Wars begins by pointing out the familiar news that, after heart disease, cancer is the leading cause of death in the United States. This tragedy, according to Proctor, “is magnified by the fact that the causes of cancer are largely known—and have been for quite some time. Cancer is caused by chemicals in the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the food we eat. Cancer is caused by bad habits, bad working conditions, bad government, and bad luck—including the luck of your genetic draw and the culture into which you're born.” Although Proctor acknowledges both environmental and genetic causes for cancer, he clearly prefers an environmental causation hypothesis to one rooted in the mysteries of molecular biology. Thus, he writes, “Who gets cancer, where, and how is a cultural artifact.” He is surprised, therefore, that our knowledge of causes has yielded so little in the “search for solutions.” He affiliates himself with the view that the war on cancer is being lost. I use the word “affiliates” because Proctor uses a persistent elusiveness in the sentence structure to build his argument. To wit: “Due to these gloomy findings [in data presented in preceding paragraphs]…, it has become hard to deny that the war on cancer is being lost” (emphasis added). The cancer research establishment, the most obvious beneficiary of the nation's “war on cancer,” then comes in for some roughing up. For example, “How can one of the largest medical efforts in history, with some of the best and brightest brains behind it, have proved so futile? Why, if cancer is so obviously a product of things like smoking, radon, and the industrial way of life, has so little been done to solve the problem at its roots?” It is a mild roughing up, however, that does little to clarify the policy issues that Proctor lays out. He asks, for example, “What are the most pressing research needs? Is it better to fund basic research into mechanisms (for example, molecular genetics), basic research into causes (for example, epidemiology), or applied research into cures (for example, chemotherapy)? When do we know enough to act, and when does the quest for knowledge impede our ability to act? And what kind of questions never get asked?” Unfortunately, Proctor provides fewer clear answers than these questions might lead one to expect.Proctor, a historian of science, sets his analysis firmly in “the political philosophy of science.” In an introductory section on “General Principles,” he lists three central questions of that endeavor: (1) “Why do we know what we know, and why don't we know what we don't know?” (2) “Who gains from knowledge (or ignorance!) of a particular sort and who loses?” (3) “How might knowledge be different, and how should it be different?” But what is the relevance of these questions? The author is not long in telling us: “Science has a face, a house, and a price: it is important to ask who is doing science, in what institutional context, and at what cost. Understanding such things can give us insight into why scientific tools are sharp for certain kinds of problems and dull for others. It might also help us see why the war against cancer is going so badly.” Although I share Proctor's view that the war on cancer has not gone well, I bring a different perspective (or bias) to the discussion. Some time ago I wrote a legislative history of the National Cancer Act of 1971. 1 The act was the work of Mary Lasker, Benno Schmidt Sr., Laurence Rockefeller, and Elmer Bobst and enlisted in its ranks Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), Rep. Paul G. Rogers (D-FL), and President Richard M. Nixon. The initiating factor was a 1969 cut in President Nixon's budget request for the National Cancer Institute (NCI). New legislation was not needed technically or legally, nor was a compelling scientific justification advanced. The rhetorical justification by advocates of an expanded cancer research effort was overblown, even outrageous. The noncancer representatives of the scientific community presented a united front of skepticism about claims that money was the rate-limiting factor in progress against cancer, in essence arguing that the increased marginal cost (including the opportunity cost to noncancer research) would not yield commensurate marginal benefit. Realists understood, however, that the legislation would provide the basis for increasing appropriations to the NCI.Although great fear was expressed at the time that an Admiral Rickover-style of research “management,” more appropriate to building nuclear-powered submarines, would be applied to an area in which scientific ignorance was so vast, those fears were never realized. The act was passed, the money flowed, and much good science was supported (some of which was critical, for example, to describing the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, in the 1980s). Still, progress against cancer has been very slow, confined mostly to the leukemias and lymphomas, barely discernible in the case of many slow-growing tumors. In this context, I am compelled to say that Cancer Wars is not very instructive as policy analysis. Nor is it really a very good analysis of politics, notwithstanding its ambitious subtitle. Consider the following questions that might have been addressed: First, why has the environmental hypothesis about cancer causation gained so few adherents over the past two or three decades? Large industrial interests, mainly the chemical industry, are clearly identified as political actors who are set against environmental explanations. Less obviously culpable, the cancer establishment is implicated on the grounds that it prefers to conduct research at the molecular level than at the epidemiological level. This view, correct in part, conveniently overlooks the major support for epidemiological research provided by the NCI, especially when compared with other entities in the National Institutes of Health (NIH). What of members of the larger, noncancer biomedical research establishment? Are they unconcerned about roughly $2 billion a year that is not well spent? Do they “duke it out” with the cancer researchers in any arenas? One cannot find answers to these questions in this book. Moreover, if the cancer research establishment is pursuing its own self-interest over more scientifically attractive lines of inquiry, the medical community, Congress, and other sources of informed opinion in our society are hardly free of responsibility on such a central issue. (Presumably, not all of these parties are tied by self-interest to the chemical industry.) Have they all been gulled into submission to a view that is fundamentally in error? We are not informed on this question.Second, why has the research dollar in the war on cancer gone mainly to the NCI and not to the National Institute for Environmental Health Sciences or to the Environmental Protection Agency? There is no discussion of this question. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has confronted industrial opposition—not adequately recounted here—but we have no extended discussion of this agency's fortunes as a function of insidious “politics.” Nor is there a sustained examination of NCI efforts in prevention research over more than two decades.Third, if one is prepared to believe that some cancers, but probably not all cancers, are caused by environmental carcinogens, how does one choose between, say, a Devra Davis and a Richard Peto? As Proctor indicates, Davis has clearly earned a certain measure of recognition for her advocacy of environmental causation of cancer. Peto has been one of her antagonists. How is a responsible citizen, well-educated in general but not expert in the science, to weigh an argument among experts? Should one pick an expert one likes, or agrees with? Proctor makes much of the “social construction of ignorance,” but he offers little guidance to those disposed to entertain the environmental hypothesis but insistent on the rigorous acquisition and analysis of data in confronting such questions.Fourth, why devote a full chapter to radon and none to breast cancer? Proctor does discuss briefly (pages 237-243) the genetic predisposition of some women toward breast cancer. Also, he examines the controversy over the proportion of breast cancer cases attributable to genetics, considers the problems of population screening, and notes the likelihood that fear of heritability of this cancer will increase. But the section ends inconclusively in policy terms without a clear indication of whether the author believes that there has been a misallocation of research relative to this most-feared of the cancers. In the very next section, however, he states: “One problem with the recent fascination with predisposition studies [that is, studies of genetic histories of families] is that they too easily distract from the fact that cancer is a disease whose incidence varies according to diet, occupation, socioeconomic status, and personal habits such as smoking. Genetics may eventually tell us who is more likely to get certain kinds of cancer … but it will never tell us anything interesting about large-scale shifts in cancer patterns, patterns that have to do with changing exposures to carcinogens.”One wishes at points such as this to stop the discussion and insist on an answer to the question, What is to be done? Or, What is to be done differently from what is being done now? What explicit counsel does the author provide to those in authority? And what are the political forces that are clustered around, say, breast cancer and that prevent us as individuals and as a society from doing the right thing? Quite surprisingly, given the thread of the discussion, Proctor advances a rather limp set of overall policy recommendations at the end of the book: Impose “suffer taxes on tobacco sales and a halt to tobacco subsidies,” establish “stiffer supervision of pesticides and federal support for integrated pest management and other alternatives to petrochemical agriculture,” modify “trade practices at home that encourage cancer abroad,” and finally, interpret prevention as “a more broad-minded approach to the kinds of things one might consider as causes of cancer.” Some of the difficulty may lie in the fact that the “politics” that animates the analysis in this book is an “us-versus-them” politics. It is a politics that takes sides and fails to present a very nuanced view of reality. Without question, the tobacco industry is retrograde regarding the issue of smoking and lung cancer. The control of industrial pollution or occupational hazards has been marked by controversy. But to ask that one accept the proposition that we as a nation have been wrong-headed in the science we have supported and, further, that this is due to political forces animated by narrow self-interest is more of a stretch than most thoughtful persons will be prepared to make.",0278-2715 2694-233X,-1,openalex,1780,,,,221

This paper reviews occupational carcinogens, and presents the most relevant risk relations to cancer in high-income countries using France as an example, to provide a framework for national estimation of cancer burden attributable to occupational exposure. Methods Occupational exposures that should be included in cancer burden studies were evaluated using multiple criteria: classified as carcinogenic or probably carcinogenic by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Monographs volumes 1–114, being a primary occupational exposure, historical and current presence of the exposure in France and the availability of exposure and risk relation data. Relative risk estimates were obtained from published systematic reviews and from the IARC Monographs. Results Of the 118 group 1 and 75 group 2A carcinogens, 37 exposures and 73 exposure-cancer site pairs were relevant. Lung cancer was associated with the most occupational carcinogenic exposures (namely, 18), followed by bladder cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Ionising radiation was associated with the highest number of cancer sites (namely, 20), followed by asbestos and working in the rubber manufacturing industry. Asbestos, bis(chloromethyl)ether, nickel and wood dust had the strongest effect on cancer, with relative risks above 5. Conclusions A large number of occupational exposures continues to impact the burden of cancer in high-income countries such as France.

Chemopreventive intervention can occur throughout carcinogenesis. Many specific food components (e.g. calcium, selenium, folic acid) may also be suitable for chemopreventive use. Chemopreventive drugs are usually administered chronically and are expected to have low toxicity. A variety of mechanisms explain the actions of chemopreventive compounds including modification of carcinogen activation and cellular uptake, inhibition of aberrant signal transduction, induction of apoptosis and inhibition of angiogenesis. As our understanding of carcinogenesis has developed, more specific pharmacologic targets are being selected, e.g. retinoid receptors or cyclo-oxygenases. Definitive, large-scale placebo-controlled randomized trials are necessary to determine the clinical efficacy of chemopreventive compounds. Recent examples include the striking effectiveness of tamoxifen in reducing the risk of breast cancer in women at high risk. Conversely, beta carotene increased the risk of lung cancer in those who continued to smoke and/or who were exposed to asbestos. The future development of predictive risk models that take into account gene-environment interactions will be of considerable value in deciding on specific chemopreventive interventions in those at increased risk by virtue of life style or occupational exposures.",0923-7534 1569-8041,-1,openalex,1579,,,,223

As of 2007, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) identified 415 known or suspected carcinogens. Cancer arises through an extremely complicated web of multiple causes, and we will likely never know the full range of agents or combinations of agents. We do know that preventing exposure to individual carcinogens prevents the disease. Declines in cancer rates-such as the drop in male lung cancer cases from the reduction in tobacco smoking or the drop in bladder cancer among cohorts of dye workers from the elimination of exposure to specific aromatic amines-provides evidence that preventing cancer is possible when we act on what we know. Although the overall age-adjusted cancer incidence rates in the United States among both men and women have declined in the last decade, the rates of several types of cancers are on the rise; some of which are linked to environmental and occupational exposures. This report chronicles the most recent epidemiologic evidence linking occupational and environmental exposures with cancer. Peer-reviewed scientific studies published from January 2005 to June 2007 were reviewed, supplementing our state-of-the-evidence report published in September 2005. Despite weaknesses in certain individual studies, we consider the evidence linking the increased risk of several types of cancer with specific exposures somewhat strengthened by recent publications, among them brain cancer from exposure to non-ionizing radiation, particularly radiofrequency fields emitted by mobile telephones; breast cancer from exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) before puberty; leukemia from exposure to 1,3-butadiene; lung cancer from exposure to air pollution; non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) from exposure to pesticides and solvents; and prostate cancer from exposure to pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and metal working fluids or mineral oils. In addition to NHL and prostate cancer, early findings from the National Institutes of Health Agricultural Health Study suggest that several additional cancers may be linked to a variety of pesticides. Our report also briefly describes the toxicological evidence related to the carcinogenic effect of specific chemicals and mechanisms that are difficult to study in humans, namely exposures to bis-phenol A and epigenetic, trans-generational effects. To underscore the multi-factorial, multi-stage nature of cancer, we also present a technical description of cancer causation summarizing current knowledge in molecular biology. We argue for a new cancer prevention paradigm, one based on an understanding that cancer is ultimately caused by multiple interacting factors rather than a paradigm based on dubious attributable fractions. This new cancer prevention paradigm demands that we limit exposure to avoidable environmental and occupational carcinogens, in combination with additional important risk factors like diet and lifestyle. The research literature related to environmental and occupational causes of cancer is constantly growing, and future updates will be carried out in light of new biological understanding of the mechanisms and new methods for studying exposures in human populations. The current state of knowledge is sufficient to compel us to act on what we know. We repeat the call of ecologist Sandra Steingraber: ""From the right to know and the duty to inquire flows the obligation to act.""",0048-7554,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1367, 1147, 1505",,,,225

Although rehabilitation specialists could offer assistance, oncologic rehabilitation is still underutilized and not a routine part of clinical oncology guidelines worldwide. Global investigations of disease prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) for tracheal, bronchus, and lung (TBL) cancer are valuable for facilitating clinical practice improvement and health resource management. The objective of this study is to report the global estimates of rehabilitation needs and disease burden of TBL cancers from 1990 to 2019 and provide predictions for 2045. Methods: To estimate the need for rehabilitation, the data used from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2019 to calculate the prevalence, YLDs, and the attributable risk factors of TBL cancer. The Bayesian age-period-cohort model and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average model were established to forecast the future health burden. All analyses were done at the global level and then some in the aggregation with the seven World Bank regions. All the data were analyzed by R software (x64 version 4.2.1) and Microsoft Excel (version 2019). Results: Globally in 2019, 3,212,307 cases of TBL cancer (95% UI 2,937,037-3,488,346) could have benefitted from rehabilitation, contributing to 544,215 (95% UI 396,134-700,099) YLDs. Over the past 30 years, the age-standardized rate (ASR) of prevalence (EAPC = 0.51) and YLDs (EAPC = 0.03) increased. Throughout this period, the global prevalence and YLDs counts were greater in males than females. The ASR of prevalence and YLDs are projected to show a slight downward trend by 2045 on the global scale, the overall prevalence and YLDs due to TBL cancer are likely to increase further, but all indicators show a growing trend in females. Conclusion: TBL cancer remains one of the major public health issues globally. According to the forecasted results, the burden of YLDs due to TBL cancer will continue to rise, and the increment is higher in females than males. A rising number of patients worldwide will benefit from rehabilitation services in the future to achieve precise control and management throughout the TBL cancer patient lifecycle.",2234-943X,-1,embase,1016,,,,226

Classified as a lung carcinogen by the World Health Organization, radon is a proven cause of lung cancer in case of regular inhalation over a long period, and the risk increases with cumulative exposure. Radon exposure was reconstructed for various standard profiles of house occupancy. A risk model derived from a European epidemiological study was used to calculate the lifetime probability of death from lung cancer according to these standard profiles. Risk assessment of the occupants of the house highlighted the following main findings. For a resident school child having been exposed to radon from birth to the age of 7, the lifetime relative risk (LRR) was estimated at 5. For last adult and young adult residents having lived more than 10years in the house, the probability of death from lung cancer was in the same order of magnitude as that of a regular cigarette smoker, with a LRR from 10 to 13 and a lifetime probability of death from lung cancer between 3 and 4%. If these individuals smoked regularly, in addition to being exposed to radon, this probability would be between 6 and 32% (supposing an additive or multiplicative interaction). For former occupants (non-smokers) having been exposed 10years during childhood, the LRR was two-fold lower. For children having been in day care in the house, the increased probability of death from lung cancer was low, with a LRR lower than 2. Supposing, as in adults, that the risk decreases beyond 30years after the end of radon exposure, the increase was almost zero for former occupants exposed during childhood and during day care, with a LRR close to 1.",0398-7620,-1,pubmed,1329,,,,227

This reflects the more frequent exposure of men to tobacco smoking and to occupations that imply contact with certain chemicals, such as aromatic amines, which are the two major recognized risk factors for bladder cancer (Matanoski and Elliott, 1981;Ross et al., 1996;Silverman et al., 1996;La Vecchia and Airoldi, 1999). Transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) is by far the most frequent histotype, although the distribution of histotypes varies in different populations. In American White populations, 93% of all bladder cancers were TCC, while they comprised 85% in American Black populations and even less in Egypt (La Vecchia and Airoldi, 1999). Tobacco and occupation, however, are risk factors also for non-TCC of the bladder (Kantor et al., 1988;Fortuny et al., 1999). Most bladder carcinogens exert their action by direct contact with the bladder epithelium. Inhaled or ingested compounds that are either directly carcinogenic or can be transformed by the body in carcinogenic by-products are excreted via the urine, and in this way they reach the urinary bladder (Cohen, 1995). There is also evidence that chronic inflammation, caused either by infections or by stones, has a role in the promotion of bladder cancer (Burin et al., 1995). Descriptive epidemiology The interpretation of incidence rates of bladder cancer is difficult, since it is not easy to distinguish between papillomas and malignant tumour, and thus the rates recorded in various cancer registries may partly reflect different diagnostic criteria (Hankey et al., 1991;Lynch et al., 1991). This caution notwithstanding, the highest incidence rates are recorded in Europe and North America, although North Africa and Western Asia are also high-risk areas (Parkin et al., 1999). In Europe, the highest incidence rates for men were recorded in northern Italy, Spain and Geneva, Switzerland, with rates of over 30 per 100 000 men, while rates were intermediate in the UK, Germany and France and low in several eastern and northern European countries as well as in most other Swiss registration areas (Levi et al., 1998). The highest mortality rates in men were around 9/100 000 men in Denmark, Italy, Malta and Spain, while low rates (around 4/100 000 men) were recorded in Sweden, Finland and Iceland. In women, the highest mortality rates were between 2 and 3/100 000 women and were recorded in Denmark and the UK (Levi et al., 1998). With regard to time trends, incidence rates tended to increase in both sexes in the United States in the period 1969–1990, whereas mortality tended to decline, particularly in men (Silverman et al., 1996). In Europe, mortality rates increased in southern and Eastern Europe between the mid-1950s and the late 1980s, while a decline was observed in several northern European countries over the last two decades (La Vecchia et al., 1992;Levi et al., 1999). This pattern was similar to that of lung cancer, and underlines the importance of tobacco smoking as an aetiologic factor, as well as the size of the tobacco-related cancer epidemic in Eastern Europe (Levi et al., 1999). Risk factors Cigarette smoking and occupational exposure to aromatic amines are known risk factors for bladder cancer. Several other factors (Table 1Table 1: Overview of potential risk and protective factors for bladder cancer) may influence bladder carcinogenesis (Matanoski and Elliott, 1981;Ross et al., 1996;Silverman et al., 1996; La Vecchia et al., 1999). In the following sections, each factor is briefly discussed. Tobacco The association between cigarette smoking and bladder cancer has been known for several decades, and has been consistently observed in a number of case–control and cohort studies. The risk of bladder cancer in smokers is 2–4 times that of non-smokers, and increases with number of cigarettes and duration of smoking (US Office on Smoking and Health, 1982;Hartge et al., 1987;Augustine et al., 1988;Dolin, 1991). In heavy smokers, the risk increases up to fivefold as compared with never smokers. The risk is higher for smokers of unfiltered, high tar or black tobacco cigarettes than for filtered, low-tar or blond-tobacco ones (Matanoski and Elliott, 1981;Hartge et al., 1987;Wynder et al., 1988;D'Avanzo et al., 1990). Former smokers have a 30–60% lower risk of bladder cancer than current ones, but published studies have not been totally consistent with respect to the relation of risk with time since quitting (IARC, 1985;Silverman et al., 1996). It is not clear whether exposure to tobacco, other than cigarette smoking, increases the risk of bladder cancer. Several studies reported an increased risk for pipe smokers, while the relation with cigars, snuff and chewing is still unsettled (Silverman et al., 1996). It is not clear which of the several carcinogens contained in cigarette smoke are responsible for this association. Besides aromatic amines (Patrianakos and Hoffman, 1979), tar and selected tobacco hydrocarbons can also be carcinogenic for the bladder (Ross et al., 1996). Occupation Several occupations have been associated with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Excesses of bladder cancer have been reported among workers employed in aromatic amine manufacture, dyestuff manufacture and use, rubber manufacture, painting, aluminium industry, leather industry and truck drivers and other drivers (Matanoski and Elliott, 1981;Moolgavkar and Stevens, 1981; IARC, 1982;IARC, 1989;Silverman et al., 1996;La Vecchia and Airoldi, 1999). A number of other occupations have also been associated with increased risk of bladder cancer, although the evidence is less convincing (Silverman et al., 1996). Exposure to some aromatic amines, and particularly 2-naphthylamine and benzidine (IARC, 1987) is the major determinant of the excesses of bladder cancer observed in workers in several types of industries, such as dyestuff or rubber manufactures. In a study of 664 dyestuff factory workers in northern Italy exposed to 2-naphthylamine, benzidine and other aromatic amines, 41 deaths from bladder carcinoma were registered (i.e. 46 times the expected number). The large number of cases in the cohort allowed the evaluation of the role of several time factors, according to different models of carcinogenesis (Decarli et al., 1985;Piolatto et al., 1991). According to these models, workers directly involved in the manufacture of aromatic amines had a higher risk than those with an intermittent exposure. Moreover, the risk was higher for workers exposed at younger ages, also after controlling for duration. This suggests that aromatic amines may act on one of the early stages of the carcinogenic process (Armitage and Doll, 1961;Day and Brown, 1980). Thus, workers exposed to aromatic amines should be monitored several years after cessation of exposure. However, the relative risk, but not the absolute risk, tended to decrease after exposure ceased, suggesting that aromatic amines may also have a late stage effect in the process of carcinogenesis (Piolatto et al., 1991). The presence of aromatic amines in hair dyes may explain the increased risk found in hairdressers in some studies. This has raised concern for the personal use of hair dyes, but the studies that investigated this issue have not found an increase in risk of bladder cancer associated with personal use of hair dyes (Hartge et al., 1982;IARC, 1993;La Vecchia and Tavani, 1995). Fluid intake and water source A higher amount of fluid intake may dilute metabolites in the urine and increase the frequency of voiding, thus reducing contact of carcinogens with the bladder epithelium. Consistent with this hypothesis, data from the Health Professionals Follow-up Study found that men in the highest fluid intake category had half the risk of bladder cancer as compared with those in the lowest one, and the protection was observed for water as well as for other fluid intake (Michaud et al., 1999a). Epidemiological results, however, are not totally consistent (Slattery et al., 1988;Brockmöller et al., 1994;Wilkens et al., 1996), perhaps because of the difficulties in measuring total fluid intake, and the issue remains therefore unsettled (Jones and Ross, 1999). The source of the drinking water may also be important. Some studies found that drinking tap water disinfected with chlorine and containing chlorination by-products may increase the risk of bladder cancer (Kiemeney and Schoenberg, 1996;Cantor et al., 1998). Arsenic in drinking water has also been associated with increased risk of bladder cancer in Taiwan (Chen et al., 1986) and Argentina (Hopenhayn-Rich et al., 1996). Coffee Caffeine and its metabolites, as well as several other compounds contained in coffee, are excreted in the urine, and thus, a role of coffee in bladder carcinogenesis is plausible. There is no clear evidence of a carcinogenic effect of coffee or caffeine in experimental animals (IARC, 1991). In humans, a case–control study of bladder cancer published in 1971 (Cole, 1971) reported an association with coffee consumption. Thereafter, over 30 studies have investigated the association between coffee and bladder cancer. They generally reported a higher risk in coffee drinkers as compared with non-drinkers, but no trend with dose or duration (IARC, 1991;La Vecchia, 1993). The largest study published to date is a case–control study conducted in 10 geographic areas of the United States on 2982 incident cases of bladder cancer and 5782 population controls (Hartge et al., 1983). It reported relative risks (RR) of 1.6 and 1.2 respectively in male and female ever-coffee drinkers with respect to non-drinkers, and the combined estimate was 1.4. Among drinkers, men in the highest consumption category had the highest odds ratio, but no evidence of any dose–response relation was noted for women. Thus, the results from epidemiological studies exclude a strong association between coffee and bladder cancer risk, although a modest one cannot be ruled out. The question of whether this association is causal, or due to residual confounding by smoking or to an association between coffee drinking and an as yet unidentified risk factor is still unresolved. The epidemiological evidence on decaffeinated coffee is scanty and inadequate for evaluation (La Vecchia, 1993). Artificial sweeteners In 1977, a case–control study on 408 cases reported a 60% increase in risk of bladder cancer in men (but not women) who used artificial sweeteners (Howe et al., 1977). Thereafter, several other studies have investigated the issue, and in general, failed to confirm the association. The largest and more informative study was a case–control study conducted in 10 areas of the USA on over 3000 cases and over 5700 population controls (Hoover and Strasser, 1980). In that study, the RR for ever use of artificial sweeteners was 1.02 (95% CI 0.92–1.11). No association was found in men (OR = 0.99) or women (RR = 1.07), or according to type or form of artificial sweeteners, and there was no dose–response relation. In general, the overall epidemiological evidence does not support an association between saccharin and other artificial sweeteners and bladder cancer, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has recently changed the evaluation of saccharin from group 2B (possibly carcinogenic to humans) to group 3 (not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans) (IARC, 1999). Diet Many compounds contained in food and their metabolites are execreted through the urinary tract, and thus a role of dietary factors in bladder carcinogenesis is plausible. Although there are some studies that have investigated the relation between diet and bladder cancer risk (Mettlin and Graham, 1979;Claude et al., 1986;Risch et al., 1988;Slattery et al., 1988Steineck et al., 1988, 1990La Vecchia et al., 1989;Mills et al., 1991;Nomura et al., 1991;Riboli et al., 1991;Vena et al., 1992;Chyou et al., 1993;Momas et al., 1994;Bruemmer et al., 1996;Wilkens et al., 1996;Michaud et al., 1999b), epidemiological data from analytical studies are relatively scanty, and most studies had a limited dietary questionnaire, that did not allow assessment of total energy, macro- and micronutrient intake (La Vecchia and Negri, 1996). Most studies that investigated fruit and vegetable intake reported a lower risk of bladder cancer in subjects with high consumption (La Vecchia and Negri, 1996), including the Health Professional Follow-up Study, based on 252 cases of bladder cancer, which found an inverse association between bladder cancer risk and intake of cruciferous vegetables (Michaud et al., 1999b). Some (Steineck et al., 1990;Riboli et al., 1991;Vena et al., 1992) but not all (Nomura et al., 1991;Chyou et al., 1993) studies suggested a possible direct association with fat intake, and some studies found an inverse one with vitamin A and carotenoids intake (Mettlin and Graham, 1979;La Vecchia et al., 1989;Nomura et al., 1991;Vena et al., 1992). In the prospective study of atomic bomb survivors (Nagano et al., 2000) the RR was 0.6 for the highest versus the lowest level of vegetable intake, and 0.5 for fruit; both estimates were significant. A meta-analysis of 38 articles on six dietary variables (Steinmaus et al., 2000) estimated an RR of 0.7 (95% CI 0.5–0.9) for high vegetable, of 0.8 (95% CI 0.7–1.0) for high fruit, and of 1.4 (95% CI 1.2–1.8) for high fat. No significant association was found for meat (RR = 1.0), retinol (RR = 1.0) or beta-carotene (RR = 0.9). Epidemiological data remain inadequate to allow definite insight on the role of diet and specific dietary factors in bladder carcinogenesis (La Vecchia and Negri, 1996). Urinary tract diseases Several studies have found a higher prevalence of bladder cancer in areas with a high prevalence of infection with Schistosoma haematobium than in those where infection is less frequent (IARC, 1994), and the percentage of squamous cell carcinoma is higher in endemic areas (Morrison and Cole, 1982;Kantor et al., 1984;Bedwani et al., 1993). Also the few analytical studies conducted in endemic areas consistently reported an association between bladder cancer and schistosomiasis (IARC, 1994;Bedwani et al., 1998). The relation has been explained through chronic irritation of the urothelium, or altered metabolism with consequent high urinary levels of carcinogenic metabolites (Matanoski and Elliott, 1981;IARC, 1994). Also other urinary tract infections and urinary tract stones may cause chronic irritation of the bladder epithelium, and may thus increase bladder cancer risk (Wynder et al., 1963;Dunham et al., 1968;Kantor et al., 1984;Gonzáles et al., 1991;La Vecchia et al., 1991;King and Marrett, 1996). Although the association with cystitis and other urinary tract infections has been observed in several case–control studies, it is difficult to rule out recall bias as a possible explanation. In general, most studies are consistent with an approximately doubled risk in patients with (recurrent) urinary tract infections, and with a possible role of these on one of the later stages of the process of carcinogenesis (La Vecchia and Airoldi, 1999). In a cohort of 61 114 Swedish patients hospitalized for kidney or urethra stones followed for up to 18 years by means of record-linkage, there were 46 cases of renal pelvis or urethra cancer, and 319 cases of bladder cancer. The corresponding standardized incidence ratios were 2.5 and 1.4 respectively (Chow et al., 1997). Thus, there is some evidence that kidney and urinary stones may moderately increase the risk of bladder cancer in humans, as they do in rodents (La Vecchia and Airoldi, 1999). Microsatellite alterations, moreover, have been reported in urinary sediments from patients with cystitis and bladder cancer (Christensen et al., 2000). Drugs Heavy consumption of phenacetin-containing analgesics has been linked to increased risk of bladder cancer, while results for acetaminophen are reassuring (Derby and Jick, 1996;Silverman et al., 1996). In a case–control study of 1514 cases from Los Angeles, the RR was 0.81 (95% CI 0.7–1.0) for regular use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 1.52 (95% CI 0.9–2.7) for phenacetin, and 0.85 (95% CI 0.6–1.2) for acetaminophen (Castelao et al., 2000). Some studies found that patients treated with cyclophosphamide for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma had an increased risk of developing bladder cancer (Silverman et al., 1996). In a few studies, treatment with phenobarbital was inversely associated with bladder cancer risk, particularly among smokers (Habel et al., 1998). Family history of bladder cancer First-degree relatives of bladder cancer patients have an approximately double risk of bladder cancer as compared with subjects with no family history of the disease (Kjaer et al., 1989). The increase in risk appears larger when the index case is young (Kantor et al. 1985;Goldgar et al., 1994). Biomarkers of cancer susceptibility To exert their carcinogenic effect, aromatic amines, like most chemical carcinogens, require metabolic activation to reactive species that bind to DNA. The activation of aromatic amines is performed by certain enzymes, whose polymorphic distribution in the population may give rise to a genetically determined different individual susceptibility. In particular, N -acetyltransferase (NAT) is an enzyme whose activity may result in the detoxification of aromatic amines. In humans it is coded by two genes, named NAT1 and NAT2 (Grant et al., 1989). The NAT2 enzyme is polymorphic, and in about 50% of Caucasians, the so-called 'slow acetylators', the activity of this enzyme is reduced. In a case–control study of bladder cancer, a large proportion of slow acetylators was observed among cases of bladder cancer occupationally exposed to aromatic amines, but not in smoking-related bladder cancer patients (Cartwright et al., 1982). Other studies, however, reported an excess of slow acetylators in bladder cancer patients with a history of smoking (Marcus et al., 2000) or occupational exposure to aromatic amines (Risch et al., 1995;Okkels et al., 1997). Glutathione S -transferase M1 (GSTM1) is an enzyme involved in the detoxification of a number of carcinogens. The genetically determined deletion of two copies of the gene coding for GSTM1 has been reported in about 50% of Caucasians. Individuals with no functional allele of the GSTM1 gene have been shown to be at higher risk of bladder cancer in several studies (Bell et al., 1993;Daly et al., 1993;Bruemmer et al., 1997;La Vecchia and Airoldi, 1999). Implications for prevention There are several factors that are known to influence bladder cancer carcinogenesis. The proportion of bladder cancer attributable to each factor (population attributable risk), however depends not only on the relative risk associated to a factor, but also on the frequency of exposure, and thus varies according to geographical area and calendar period. Cigarette smoking is the major identified cause of bladder cancer. The proportion of cases attributable to tobacco was about 80% in men and 30% in women in a study in Great Britain (Monson and Christiani, 1997), about 50% in men and 30% in women in a study from the United States (Hartge et al., 1987), around 70% in men and 30% in women in a study from Italy (D'Avanzo et al., 1995) and over 70% in men (but very low in women) in Alexandria, Egypt (Bedwani et al., 1997). Clearly, reducing cigarette smoking is an imperative for prevention of bladder cancer. Occupational exposure to aromatic amines and other chemicals has been estimated to cause 5–10% of bladder cancers in Great Britain and North America (Monson and Christiani, 1997). In several developed countries, the control of occupational exposure to bladder carcinogens has probably led to a substantial decrease of the proportion of cases of bladder cancer due to occupational factors, and this reduction may become even more evident in the next decades, when the effects of exposure that occurred decades ago will affect incidence rates to a smaller degree. Less information is available for some other heavily industrialized areas of the world, where measures to reduce occupational hazard may still not be adequate (La Vecchia and Airoldi, 1999). Reduction of infection by Schistosoma haematobium is an important preventive measure in endemic areas, such as, for instance, Egypt and Tanzania. It is difficult to quantify the potential for prevention of reducing urinary tract infections in other populations. Selected aspects of diet may influence bladder carcinogenesis but – apart from a possibly favourable effect of vegetable and fruit consumption – available data are still inadequate to provide indications for prevention.

They belong to the chrysotile and amphibole groups of minerals. Chrysotile from most parts of the world consists of soft, curly, pliable fibers which tend to split progressively into finer fibrils, whereas amphibole fibers, in general, are harsh and rigid even when very fine. Their various properties determine the uses to which they are put in industry and, in certain respects, may be responsible for their apparently different behavior in the lungs and pathogenic potential. At the present time there is no evidence that the concentrations of airborne asbestos to which the public may be exposed causes asbestosis or malignant mesothelioma (Report of the Advisory Committee on Asbestos Cancers 1973), though it is probably mainly responsible for the frequency with which asbestos (or 'ferruginous') bodies are found in the lungs of members of urban populations. Under experimental conditions short asbestos fibers (that is less than about 10 μm) are engulfed by alveolar macrophages, but longer fibers cannot be properly ingested, in which case a number of macrophages become attached to them. The permeability of the cellular membranes of these cells is increased. Short fibers are taken up into phagosomes and endogenous iron (ferritin) is deposited on them. This process, and the deposition of mucopolysaccharides which accompanies it, appear to be important in the production of asbestos bodies in both human and animal lungs. The mechanism by which asbestos causes pulmonary fibrosis may release a fibrogenic factor. If this is so, however, the pathogenic process is undoubtedly different from that of silicosis. Neither is the causation of malignant mesothelioma understood. The clinical aspects of lung asbestosis, pleurisy and malignant mesothelioma are reviewed.

Most prominently, lawsuits brought by US state attorneys general in the mid-1990s seeking reimbursement for expenses incurred in treating residents for smoking-related diseases forced the industry to begin disgorging incriminating internal documents, with over 14 million now available on the internet, detailing industry misbehavior around the world (http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu). Public exposure of these misdeeds made the tobacco industry politically toxic, easing the way for subsequent regulatory legislation. Under the Master Settlement Agreement resolving these cases, the industry agreed to eliminate various marketing techniques and promotional stratagems and pay the states about $10 billion/year, resulting in dramatic cigarette price increases that greatly reduced teenage smoking. Some of that money went into effective tobacco control programs. Every stage of tobacco litigation (initial filings, motions, hearings, decisions, appeals) provides 'teachable moments' for public education about the underlying issues: the health consequences of smoking, addictiveness, and tobacco industry misbehavior. The cases dramatize the impact of smoking on real people, not just statistics. Even the industry's counter-spin, that smokers who contract lung cancer 'assumed the risk', implicitly acknowledges the reality of the causal link. Product liability litigation can take many forms. Most legal systems allow individuals, including smokers or their survivors, to seek compensation for their financial and emotional losses from product manufacturers that sell unreasonably dangerous products, fail to warn about the dangers of these products, and/or actually lie about these dangers. In the USA, multimillion-dollar punitive damages, designed to deter others from misbehaving like tobacco companies, are sometimes also available. Similar cases can be brought by victims of secondhand smoke, though establishing causation in cases against tobacco manufacturers has proven extremely difficult; obtaining workers compensation from employers, however, has become fairly routine. Injuries from cigarette-caused fires are compensable, since cigarettes with low ignition propensity can easily be manufactured. Injured smokers and non-smokers are not the only possible plaintiffs: as mentioned, many US states were permitted to sue tobacco companies in the 1990s for medical costs incurred in caring for smokers whose diseases could be attributed to tobacco industry misconduct. Similar cases are pending in Israel, and most Canadian provinces now have legislation facilitating such lawsuits. Finally, legal systems sometimes permit consumers with similar claims to proceed in a single class action, greatly reducing litigation costs. In May 2015 a judge in Quebec, Canada awarded more than US$100,000/smoker to a class of about 100,000 smokers with lung or throat cancer or emphysema, as well as about $100 million to another class of addicted smokers. U.S. courts have allowed class actions to go forward to fund medical monitoring programs for long-term smokers, and to compensate smokers who were fooled into thinking that “light” cigarettes were safer than regular cigarettes. Cases can be brought to stop tobacco industry misconduct brought by parties who were not themselves injured by that behavior. Thus, the US Department of Justice brought a successful case against the major tobacco companies to prevent their continued violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. And cases can even be brought in some jurisdictions to force the government to protect the lives and health of their citizens. Thus, the Indian Supreme Court insisted upon legislation to protect nonsmokers from secondhand smoke. The efficacy of product liability litigation depends as much on procedural rules as on substantive legal doctrines (legal 'rights'). In most countries other than the USA, the absence of contingency fees (where plaintiff's lawyers are compensated with a portion of the plaintiff's judgment or settlement, if any) means the lawyers must either provide their services for free or bill their ill, dying, or bereaved clients on an ongoing basis: hence, few such cases are brought. Worse, many legal systems require plaintiffs who lose their cases to pay the defendant's legal costs, thus putting the plaintiff's remaining assets at risk. These unfortunate procedural rules can, of course, be changed by court rule or statute. Going forward Article 4.5 of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) recognizes that 'issues relating to liability are an important part of comprehensive tobacco control'. Article 19, 'Liability', provides that 'Parties shall consider taking legislative action to deal with civil liability, including compensation where appropriate'. Legislation correcting the procedural rules that prohibit contingency fees and shift litigation costs to the losing party, permitting consumer class actions, and facilitating healthcare cost recovery lawsuits, are examples of such highly desirable legislative action. Article 19 also encourages parties to assist each other in carrying out legal proceedings and to share relevant information with each other, and invites the Conference of the Parties (COP) to develop 'appropriate international approaches to these issues' as well as to support parties in their activities relating to liability. The COP has currently charged an expert group to design a mechanism for collecting, archiving and sharing litigation documents and for providing advice and assistance-electronically or in person-to attorneys bringing liability cases against the tobacco industry. For at least a decade tobacco company defendants in the US have admitted on their websites and ceased to deny in court that smoking is the major cause of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), though they often contest the diagnosis or aetiology in particular cases. By contrast, and despite universal availability of the internet, tobacco defendants in Europe and Asia have been remarkably successful in confusing courts on the epidemiology of smoking and disease. The recent acceleration in the globalization of tobacco control efforts, inspired by the FCTC and supported by the Bloomberg and Gates Foundations, and the commitment of parties under Article 12 of the FCTC to conduct public education on tobacco control issues, can be expected to equalize around the world knowledge of basic tobacco epidemiology. Similarly, the presence of millions of easily accessible internal tobacco industry documents on the internet should simplify the process of establishing the liability of the major transnational tobacco companies and their affiliates.",1556-0864,manual_review,embase,1081,,,,231
377,1285,"Falk, H. and Waxweiler, R.J.",1976,PROC. R. SOC. MED,,Epidemiological studies of vinyl chloride health effects in the United States,303-306,69,4,"The vinyl chloride (VC) problem has had a considerable impact in the United States, which has so far had the largest share of cases of VC-induced hepatic angiosarcoma (HAS): 17 known cases in polymerization workers. Unlike what has occurred with many other proven or suspect carcinogens, the confirmatory experimental evidence arrived almost simultaneously with the epidemiologic results. Since the VC problem also arrived at a time of growing awareness and concern among workers and consumers about environment and occupational hazards, it served to focus these concerns. Early on (1974) there was demonstrated a high percentage of liver function abnormalities in polymerization workers, and the earliest mortality studies suggested increased rates for nonhepatic tumours, parallelling the multiplicity of tumour types seen in experimental studies. Further concern was generated by reports of the potential carcinogenicity of chemicals structurally related to VC, e.g. chloroprene and trichloroethylene, and by the knowledge that VC workers in many instances have been exposed to multiple related chemicals, including vinylidene chloride and acrylonitrile (vinyl cyanide). As part of the United States Public Health Service response to the VC problem, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Bureau of Epidemiology, Center for Disease Control (CDC), have worked on a number of VC-related epidemiologic projects during the past year and a half; this paper briefly reviews some of the early results of three of these studies. A death certificate search for all cases of HAS recorded under ICD Code 197.8 (8th Revision), which encompasses various miscellaneous forms of liver tumour including most cases of HAS, was undertaken by CDC for the years 1966-73 in the United States. A review of the relative occurrence of hepatic sarcomas showed angiosarcoma to be the largest group (35% of total hepatic sarcomas), followed by sarcoma of unspecified type (31%), leiomyosarcoma (12%), fibrosarcoma (7%), and a grouping of miscellaneous sarcomas (15%). Age-sex differences are consistent with a hypothesis that occupational exposure may be a more significant factor in the causation of HAS than of non-angio hepatic sarcoma. CDC has supplemented the death certificate survey with an intensive case-finding effort, including a national mailing to all pathologists, state epidemiologists, and major cancer referral centres and tumour registries, seeking information on as many cases of HAS as possible diagnosed in the US during the years 1964-74. At the present time approximately 240 cases have been identified. Since liver function tests are relatively insensitive to the early finding of VC-induced hepatic disease (i.e. fibrosis), the results of this type of testing (SGOT, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, LDH, GGTP and ornithine carbamyl transferase), are not a reliable estimate for the prevalence of VC-induced disease. One of the results of this study was the demonstration of an increased SMR for respiratory system cancer among members of the cohort. On preliminary pathologic review, it was also noted that of the 12 lung cancer cases all 8 for which pathologic specimens were available were either large cell undifferentiated or adenocarcinoma of the lung; if confirmed, this unusual cell type distribution may support the association between VC exposure and occurrence of lung cancer. But cases of lung cancer seem not to correlate as tightly with VC exposure as cases of HAS, and it is conceivable therefore that some additional chemical exposure at these plants may be working together with VC (or even separately) to produce this effect. In the ensuing discussion it was stated that a review of known details of identified cases of vinyl-chloride-associated angiosarcoma of the liver has demonstrated that the median duration from onset of exposure was approximately seventeen years. The limited data bearing on this problem suggested that vinyl-chloride-associated disease would be an important hazard for vinyl chloride workers in the future, unless control of exposure resulted in at least some reversal of the risk.",0035-9157,manual_review,embase,1285,,,,232

There are various ways to estimate burden of disease in a population, each method's appropriateness depends on available data and the research question to be answered. We review the available methods, and assess their usefulness for predicting future occupational disease burden and for testing population-level interventions. There are several approaches to disease burden estimation: Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) applied to incident or prevalent disease cases, Lifetime Risk/Future Excess Fraction and Disease Projection (Age-Period-Cohort and structural model/'g' formula) approaches. The PAF takes into account past exposures, with intervention effects estimated from the point of intervention onwards. Lifetime risk estimates disease that workers, currently exposed to a disease-causing agent, will contract in their lifetimes; no latency assumptions are required, with interventions assumed to take effect immediately. Disease projection methods use current and past disease rates to predict rates into the future. The 'g-formula', a generalised regression model, is used to estimate the joint distribution of outcome and risk factors; Monte Carlo methods can then simulate disease risk following intervention, compared to no intervention. The methods are tested on examples of occupational disease/exposure pairings, including lung cancer from respirable crystalline silica exposure and COPD from vapour, gases, dust and fume exposure, and results are compared. The results will provide critical information on the sensitivity of some examples of occupational burden of disease and health impact studies on the modelling approach.",,-1,openalex,1753,,,,233

Standardised incidence ratios (SIRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) were calculated to compare the incidence of lung cancer among cohort participants with the general population. Cox regression was used to estimate the effect of risk factors on lung cancer risk among TB patients. Lung cancer SIRs were 3.55 (95%CI 3.24-3.89) among all cohort participants, 4.48 (95%CI 4.04-4.96) among smokers and 1.93 (95%CI 1.56-2.36) among non-smokers. SIRs declined substantially >3 years after TB diagnosis in non-smokers, although they remained significantly elevated for ⩾10 years among smokers. In the multivariable analysis, smoking, male sex and older age substantially increased the risk of lung cancer. A statistically significant association with education, employment, site of TB and alcohol consumption did not persist in the lag-time analysis.

They were first published in 1982, based on IARC Monographs. List A included industries, processes and occupations definitely entailing carcinogenic risk, list B those probably/possibly carcinogenic. In 1995 the lists had been updated. We carried out a further update, reviewing IARC Monographs Volumes 62-75, focusing on Group 1, 2 A, and 2 B agents, and coded the lists according to widely used classifications: ISIC Rev. 2, ISIC Rev. 3, NACE Rev. 1, and ISTAT ATECO 1991 (for economic activities); ILO-ISCO 1968 and ISTAT-Classificazione delle professioni 1991 (for occupations). In order to evaluate temporal and geographical variations in attributable risk, exposure assessment must be performed consistently across different studies and standard tools to identify exposures, such as the one we propose here, are needed. The lists can also help to develop maps of industrial activities entailing carcinogenic risk at local, regional, and national level, and to identify economic activities that deserve priority action to control occupational exposures to carcinogens. The classifications were originally developed for economic and demographic purposes, and some exposure circumstances cannot be coded with sufficient specificity. This applies to productions or processes (i.e.: PVC production) that could be classified only by codes corresponding to wide groups of economic activities and/or occupations: in these instances we associated no code, so as not to inflate the estimates of exposed workers. As a consequence, however, certain exposures are not represented in the coded version of the lists. Even keeping in mind such limitations, coding makes the lists easier to apply, and increases the comparability of studies on lung cancer and occupation, as well as of surveys on exposure prevalence.",,abstract_added,openalex,1537,,,,235
427,1498,Doll,1975,Archiv fur Geschwulstforschung,,Pott and the path to prevention.,521-31,45,6,"Two hundred years ago, Percival Pott, a London surgeon, recognized that chimney sweeps were particulary liable to develop scrotal cancer and attributed the disease to exposure to soot. By so doing, he described the first environmental cause of cancer and started the chain of events that led to the first experimental production of cancer, the first synthesis of a carcinogen, and the first isolation of a carcinogen from a natural substance. Following these laboratory successes, the main object of cancer research has been to discover the fundamental characteristics of the cancer cell and the mechanism of the cancer cell and the mechanism of its production and relativly few investigations have studied the conditions under which cancer is produced in man. Recently, however, it has been recognized that we can often prevent cancer by modifying the conditions of life without detailed knowledge of the mechanism of carcinogenesis. All but a few rare cancers vary in incidence with place or time or with both and nearly all this variation can be shown to be environmental in origin. We already know enough to prevent most cancers of the mouth, oesophagus, larynx, lung, bladder, and skin in W. Europe and N. America, most cancers of the mouth in Asia, and most liver cancers in Africa. We have clues to the causation of cancer of the cervix uteri, breast, and colon and we should learn how to prevent all these cancers before long. Many new hazards could be prevented by controlling the introduction of new carcinogenic chemicals into the environment while others could be detected quickly by improved methods of epidemiological enquiry.

As Belgium is a federal state with many responsibilities in health policies being transferred to the regional levels, regional breakdown of health indicators is becoming increasingly relevant for policy-makers, as a tool for planning and evaluation. We analyzed the educational disparities by region for all-cause and cause-specific premature mortality in the Belgian population. Residents with Belgian nationality at birth registered in the census 2001 aged 25–64 were included, and followed up for 10 years though a linkage with the cause-of-death database. The role of 3 socio-economic variables (education, employment and housing) in explaining the regional mortality difference was explored through a Poisson regression. Age-standardised mortality rates (ASMRs) by educational level (EL), rate differences (RD), rate ratios (RR), and population attributable fractions (PAF) were computed in the 3 regions of Belgium and compared with pairwise regional ratios. The global PAFs were also decomposed into the main causes of death. Regional health gaps are observed within each EL, with ASMRs in Brussels and Wallonia exceeding those of Flanders by about 50% in males and 40% in females among Belgian. Individual SE variables only explained up to half of the regional differences. Educational inequalities were also larger in Brussels and Wallonia than in Flanders, with RDs ratios reaching 1.8 and 1.6 for Brussels versus Flanders, and Wallonia versus Flanders respectively; regional ratios in relative inequalities (RRs and PAFs) were smaller. This pattern was observed for all-cause and most specific causes of premature mortality. Ranking the cause-specific PAFs revealed a higher health impact of inequalities in causes combining high mortality rate and relative inequality, with lung cancer and ischemic heart disease on top for all regions and both sexes. The ranking showed few regional differences. For the first time in Belgium, educational inequalities were studied by region. Among the Belgian, educational inequalities were higher in Brussels, followed by Wallonia and Flanders.

Methods The risk factors section of the GBD study uses a population attributable fraction (PAF) approach, combining relative risk estimates from the published literature with estimates of exposure prevalence. The PAFs are applied to estimates of the total number of cases or Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) of a particular disorder to produce estimates of the number of deaths or the overall burden (in DALYs) arising from individual occupational risk factors and groups of risk factors. The included risk factors are a range of carcinogens resulting in cancer; particulate matter, gases and fumes resulting in chronic obstructive lung disease; asthmagens causing asthma; noise causing noise-induced hearing loss; ergonomic risk factors causing low back pain; and injury risk factors resulting in injury. Results The preliminary results for 2016 suggest that the largest burden in terms of deaths was from carcinogens, injury risk factors and particulate matter, gases and fumes. In terms of DALYs, the largest burden was from ergonomic factors, injury risk factors, particulate matter, gases and fumes and noise. The rates and PAFs varied by region and across age and gender.

Among the patients, men were found to smoke a higher average number of cigarette-equivalents per day, for longer duration and started at an earlier age as compared to controls. Smoking of bidi and hooka as well as cigarettes had similar ORs for cumulative consumption. ORs for female smokers were lower than those for male smokers.

Residence in urban areas did not entail an increased risk for developing lung cancer. Very few subjects studied were employed in high-risk occupations. Interpretation & conclusions: Smoking (cigarettes or bidis) was the principle risk factor for causation of lung cancer among men. In women there could be several other risk factors besides smoking, as the association with smoking was not as strong.",0971-5916,title_duplicate,"embase, openalex","1195, 1524",,,,245

Prevalence for recent hires (≥1985) was similar to the background. Interstitial changes were not elevated. Localized pleural thickening was associated with small decreases in spirometry results. Increases in leukemia and urinary cancer but not lung cancer mortality were found. One death attributed to mesothelioma was observed in a worker with self-reported asbestos exposure and a work history where occupational asbestos exposure may have occurred, rendering uncertainties in assigning causation.

The condition of temporal stability, however, usually is not fulfilled in environmental health applications. In practice, cancer risks for time-dependent exposures are often estimated by calculating lifetime average exposure, assuming a mean life expectancy of 70 years. In the present paper we discuss the question whether this is an appropriate procedure considering various variants of multi stage and epidemiological relative risk models. For this purpose, lifetime risks for time dependent exposures as calculated according to the respective model assumptions, were compared with lifetime risks estimated by the lifetime average exposure approach. As typical exposure histories in environmental health applications we studied exposures either limited to the first 5 years of life (children scenario) or limited to duration of employment (30th to 65th year of age; occupational scenario). The consideration of multistage models (Armitage-Doll- and Moolgavkar-Venzon-Knudson model) in general would not induce serious bias in risk estimation when exposures are limited to middle ages (occupational scenario). On the other hand, when exposures occur only in very young ages or only in very old ages the risk estimated by using lifetime average exposure is not comparable with the predictions of multistage models. Whereas the degree of possible underestimation is bounded by factors well below 10, the amount of possible overestimation is unbounded and may become arbitrarily high, when exposures concentrate in extreme ages. In a second part of the study we investigated different relative risk models, taking lung cancer as an example. The models differed with respect to assumptions on latent periods and moderating effects of age at exposure and age at risk. The simulations showed that the unit risk concept is appropriate for the occupational scenario. For the children scenario results strongly depend on the assumptions made. Whereas the degree of possible underestimation is acceptable, in some models the degree of possible overestimation may become arbitrarily high. Both parts of the study showed that bias induced by using lifetime average exposure is acceptable when exposures are limited to middle ages. On the other hand, the unit risk concept should not uncritically be applied to exposures limited to early childhood (e.g., in kindergartens or due to mouthing activities). Depending on the assumptions made, lifetime risk may either be moderately underestimated or grossly overestimated. Without additional knowledge on mechanisms or latency period risk estimations are of questionable value. With respect to exposures in childhood regulation should concentrate on initiating substances or substances known to have long latent periods, respectively. With respect to cancers which occur relatively frequent already in childhood specific considerations are recommended.",,abstract_added,openalex,1685,,,,248

Understanding these discrepancies is pivotal for crafting targeted interventions to mitigate health disparities. To comprehensively assess these inequalities, this study delves into the association between smoking and lung cancer incidence within a diverse cohort of 5270 participants, comprising both AA (868 participants) and EA (3137 participants) individuals. Among the 2901 lung cancer patients identified in our analysis, diagnoses ranged from Malignant Tumors of the Lung to various subtypes of Non-Small Cell and Small Cell Lung Cancer. Surprisingly, only a significant subset of these patients were smokers, with statistical analysis indicating a p<0.001, pointing to other influential demographic factors. Employing the Chi-Square Test of Independence, Logistic Regression, and Multivariate Analysis, we evaluated the impact of smoking alongside additional variables on lung cancer incidence. Factors such as Age, Gender, Socioeconomic Status, Occupational Exposures, Geographic Location, Family History of Cancer, Comorbidities, and Lifestyle Factors were considered in the multivariate analyses to ascertain their contribution to lung cancer risks. Our findings from Relative Risk (RR) and Attributable Risk (AR) assessments suggest that while smoking constitutes a notable risk factor, a substantial proportion of lung cancer cases in this cohort were not linked to smoking. Stratified and Sensitivity Analyses further unveiled nuanced risk profiles within subgroups, elucidating the intricate interplay between lifestyle factors and genetic predispositions. Our study highlights that a significant portion of lung cancer cases, particularly among EA and AA populations, occur in non-smokers, with smoking often associated with other comorbidities rather than solely lung- specific diseases. This underscores the multifaceted nature of lung cancer risk factors across different racial groups, advocating for public health strategies that address a broader spectrum of influences beyond smoking to combat cancer disparities within these communities effectively.",1055-9965,-1,"embase, openalex","1006, 1740",,,,250

Burden of occupational cancer projects are an effective tool for drawing attention to the magnitude of the problem and promoting prevention. We present here some major results from the Canadian Burden of Occupational Cancer project and discuss its use for prevention. Methods Our methods are based on a similar UK project, with several enhancements. The historic labour force was identified using 1961 through 2001 Census data. Occupational exposure prevalence was estimated using CAREX Canada data, allowing calculation of levels of exposure for 44 carcinogens. Relative risks were based on large epidemiologic studies and meta-analyses representative of Canadian exposure circumstances. Standard methods with Levin’s equation were used to calculate attributable fractions. Result Exposure to solar radiation was responsible for the largest number of cancers (4550 basal and squamous cell carcinomas annually, 6.3% of all non-melanoma skin cancer). Asbestos came second with 425 mesotheliomas (80.5% of mesothelioma, including para-occupational, but not environmental, exposure), 1900 lung cancers (8.0% of lung cancer), and smaller numbers of larynx and, ovarian, and suspected other cancers. Diesel engine exhaust was responsible for 560 lung cancers (2.4% of lung cancer) and suspected for 200 bladder cancers (2.7% of bladder cancer). Crystalline silica and welding fumes were responsible for 570 and 315 lung cancers (2.4% and 1.3% of all), respectively. Shiftwork resulting in circadian disruption was suspected for between 460 and 1180 breast cancers (2.0%–5.2% of all), annually. Discussion Results from the project have begun to be used by Canadian regulatory organisations to establish priorities and by advocacy organisations to raise awareness and push for policy change. These efforts and the input from burden estimates have played a role in the governmental campaign to ban asbestos, now scheduled for 2018.",1044-3983 1531-5487,-1,openalex,1725,,,,251
144,1611,Steven I. Hajdu,2006,Cancer,10.1002/cncr.21807,Thoughts about the cause of cancer,1643-1649,106,8,"History teaches that the discovery of cure for a disease rarely precedes the knowledge of its cause. Therefore, it is perhaps important to review attempts, in a timeline presentation, that were made to discover the cause of cancer in humans. Ancient peoples from prehistoric times believed that cancer was caused by evil spirits, natural forces, contact with wicked men, and disharmony of the planets. According to Hebrew, Greek, and Roman teachings, cancer was caused by sin, violation of religious rules, and the wrath of gods. Hippocrates (BC 460-375) and his disciples were opposed to superstitions and hypothesized that excess or deficiency of blood, mucus, and bile could cause cancer, particularly in old age. Galen (AD 131-203) and his followers, in the Roman Empire and beyond, believed that accumulation of black bile in the breast, uterus, lips, and hemorrhoids caused cancer. Galen's theory was accepted as doctrine by medical practitioners and organized religions for sixteen centuries with little modification. In the early Middle Ages, accumulation of noxious substances in blood as cause of disease, including cancer, was added to Galen's humoral theory and led to introduction of blood letting. Although alchemists, astrologers, and contagion theorists pressed their own thoughts, Galen's doctrine withstood all challenges throughout the Middle Ages.1 With revolutionary fervor, an outspoken Swiss physician and chemist, Paracelsus (1493-1541), was the first to openly oppose the Galenists, and Paracelsus almost got away with it. But his opponents caught up with him in Salzburg, Austria, and beat him to death. Paracelsus proposed that deposits of salt of sulfur and arsenic in blood cause cancer, particularly in miners, masons, chemists, and metallurgists.2 He left for us the first description of an association between occupational diseases and cancer. Ambroise Paré (1510-1590), a distinguished French surgeon, felt that the antecedent cause of cancer was an irregular diet that induced accumulation of feculent material in the blood. Overheating changed this material to a corrosive substance that produced ulceration of the cancer.3 Discoveries by anatomists in the 1500s, discovery of blood circulation in 1628 by William Harvey (1578-1657), and the description of lymphatics by Thomas Bartholin (1616-1680) in 1656 introduced the concept of coagulation and fermentation of the blood and lymph as the cause of cancer. By observing deterioration (ulceration and necrosis) of various organs harboring cancer, surgeons pointed out that cancer was a destructive growth and was caused by internal structural transformation of glandular and vascular organs.4 Although surgeons did not support the humorists' theories, most physicians continued to accept them with some modification. Noted Dutch physician, chemist, teacher, and bibliographer Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738) believed that cancer was an outlet to the accumulated bad humors that contained the cancer virus (some sort of toxic substance). Venous and lymphatic obstructions facilitated accumulation of this material similarly to accumulation of urea in the urine in urinary obstruction. Boerhaave held that the source of the cancer virus (the bad substance) was most likely in the water or in the soil. After the cancer virus was acquired, he wrote,5 it remained in the body in such a way that it could be transferred to children by heredity and to members of the family by contagion. His thought forwarded earlier Middle Ages beliefs that cancer was contagious, and cancer patients should be isolated in out-of-town hospitals. After all that was written and spoken about cancer by the early 1700s, everybody was convinced that schirrous and scrophulous tumors, all cancers, were the result of coagulation and stagnation of the flow of blood and chyle. Ulceration was a particularly bad thing and was caused by accumulation of corrosive acids, deprivation of nourishment, and changes in the shape of the moon.6 Surgeons advocated excision of all swellings, polyps, and tumefactions before they became cancerous.7 Promotion of early and aggressive treatment by excision superheated the conflict between surgeons (pioneer surgical oncologists) and physicians (pioneer medical oncologists) that lasted for centuries. In 1775, Percivall Pott (1714-1788) reported8 an occupational cancer, chimney sweeps' cancer of the scrotum, by long-standing accumulation of soot in the perineoscrotal skin. He believed that soot was an irritant due to its contents, such as ammonia, sulfur, and arsenic. Pott also described cancer of the tongue and cheek caused by carious teeth. The first monograph on cancer was written by Bernard Peyrilhe (1735-1804) and was published in 1776 (Fig. 1). On one hundred thirty-five pages, Peyrilhe presented his thinking and all that was known about cancer prior to his time.9 He explained that he wrote the book because the extent of ignorance about cancer was embarrassing. He continued to believe, along with others,5, 6 that there was a cancer virus, but nobody in the whole world, he wrote, knew what it was. As to development of cancer, he thought that the process was similar to how chickens develop from eggs under incubation. Once the blood, lymph, and bile are accumulated by stagnation, fermentation begins to take place. Fermentation is facilitated by heat, humidity, obstruction of vessels, alterations in blood by long use of medications, diminution of transpiration, and cessation of menstruation. Ulceration and local putrefaction (necrosis) are aided by application of corrosive chemicals, long duration, decreased circulation, absence of air, and rupture of cellular tissues (fat and parenchyma). And, he added, cancer attacks sick people, particularly ones who are icteric with scirrhous (firm) liver and have hydropic belly. Peyrilhe believed that the cancerous virus is transmitted from parents to children and others through the air, saliva, and other body secretions. Hence, isolation of cancer patients in cancer wards was justified. Title page of Bernard Peyrilhe's Dissertation on Cancer, 1776 (See Reference 9). Reprinted from the author's private collection. The first illustrated medical dictionary published in 1791 in London10 listed overheated minute lymphatic vessels as the proximate cause of cancer. Changes induced by celibacy, increased body heat, scanty and irregular menstrual flow, sorrow or other disturbances of the mind contributed to conversion of the inspissated material into cancer. It was added, as an aside, that earlier suspicion of small worms in ulcerated cancers now can be confirmed with the aid of the microscope. As examination of corpses of deceased cancer patients became common near the end of the eighteen century, questions arose concerning whether the cause of cancers in different organs was the same. Not having anything to point to as a cause, early researchers concluded that cancer was an idiopathic affection and was linked to cancerous diathesis.11 With the introduction of this new thought, trauma, irritation, and inflammation were looked upon as sorts of honing devices for cancer, but alone they could not cause cancer without cancer diathesis, a predisposition. This theory received wide acceptance because it explained the frequent origin of cancer without apparent cause. Soon, it was added,12 that there were two kinds of predisposition, hereditary and acquired. Among hereditary examples, cancer in both breasts and cancer in the uterus and breast were listed. Cancer of the stomach was recorded as an acquired disease and was thought to be caused by chronic inflammation, ulceration, and cicatrization. The first definitive work13 listing chronic irritation, chronic inflammation, burns, freezing injuries, and other external conditions as causes of acquired cancer was published in 1826. Accumulation or deposit of albumen (fibrin) in the tissues was named as the point of origin of cancer. Récamier (1774-1852) in his seminal work on cancer14 reconfirmed that there are two kinds of cancer, local and constitutional. And he continued that constitutional cancers can be hereditary similar to arthritis and strumatosis but that not all hereditary cancers are constitutional, e.g., breast cancer. As to the cause of local, so-called acquired or spontaneous cancers, he listed changes in eating habits and degeneration of preexisting benign lesions, e.g., pigmented nevi and polyps. Récamier concluded that the fact that no person is exempt from cancer must be because of dispersed embryonic rests in the body. Activation of such congenital rests by changing climate, habitation, lifestyle, or acquiring diseases, such as syphilis and tuberculosis, were further sources of cancer. The local irritation theory was extended to religious communities in cloisters, which claimed that cancer of the uterus was induced by masturbation.15 Cancer of the uterine cervix was reported as a consequence of trauma by coition and abortion. On the basis of the above statements,13-15 it was firmly held in French schools for nearly 100 years that without chronic irritation and inflammation, there is no local cancer. From the early 1800s, emerging new fields in medicine, pathophysiology, microscopic pathology, clinical chemistry, and bacteriology profoundly influenced thinking about the cause of cancer. The year 1838 was a momentous year. In Berlin, this was the year in which Theodore Schwann (1810-1882) introduced the cell theory (the theory that human and animal tissues are composed of cells), and his mentor, Johannes Mûller (1801-1858), came to the conclusion that cancers are formed from blastema.16 According to Müller, the cancerous blastema was an amorphous granular material that is exuded from blood, the mystical substance, and then by internal burst are formed. Consequently, from the nuclei germ, cells emerged and deposited in a scattered way between normal tissue elements; these served as the primary source of cancer. Within a couple of years, the blastema theory received wide acceptance. Some of the earliest believers in it were Thomas Hodgkin (1798-1866) and James Paget (1814-1899). Paget wrote in his book17 that cancer was a blood-borne disease. However, he added, because there were so many different cancers in appearance and cellular composition, the morbid material (the blastema) must be deposited from blood into a part of the body that is altered from normal, is receptive to such material, and permits its growth. He pointed out that preexisting benign tumors are good ground for such deposits. Paget admitted that the blastema is not formed from the natural constituents of blood. He speculated that the blastema is formed from some invisible particles that must be separated from blood to become cancerous. Once the particles are in the blood, they cannot be removed and are transferred from parents to children. Hermann Lebert (1813-1878), another believer in the blastema theory, went as far as claiming,18 with others,19 that there is no need to have an organ to produce cancer. The only thing needed is a capillary vessel with blood in it. Although Lebert found it surprising that despite high vascularity of the lung, the brain, and the spleen, cancer is far less common in these organs than in many other organs. He reasoned that the cancer diathesis in blood must exist for some time before it appears externally. How was it introduced into the blood he could not tell, but he found that rich people were more liable to cancer than the poor. One would believe that after announcement that cells come from cells, in 1858, by Rudolph Virchow20 (1821-1902), a student of Johannes Muller, the blastema theory was given up. No, it did not happen. The blastema theory spread all around the world. Oddly, two eminent physicians in Philadelphia in the United States, Samual D. Gross (1805-1884) and Joseph Woodward (1833-1884), held on to it longer21, 22 than most others. Woodward, in an award lecture presented22 at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., proposed that cancer cells were formed by metamorphosis from exuded white blood cells. Despite difficulties in convincing many, the blastema theory was gradually replaced by the embryonic rest theory of Julius Cohnheim (1839-1884). Cohnheim, a student of Virchow, reintroduced23 in 1877 Récamier's nearly fifty years old14 embryonic rest theory with some modifications. He named highly vascular sites, e.g., orifices and mucocutaneous junctions, as prevalent sites of unutilized embryonic cell rests. He also considered embryonic vestiges, e.g., the urachus, mesonephros, and the Gartner duct, as well as unused cell rests in the adrenal, thyroid, liver, breast, ovary, and other organs as precursors of cancer. At just about the time when the cancerous blastema theory was given up and the embryonic rest theory resurfaced, cancer of the tongue and lips were definitively linked to smoking.24 It was proven that industrial tar, coal tar, and crude paraffin caused skin cancer.25 Bladder tumors in workers in chemical and rubber factories were linked to exposure to aniline, fuchsin, and related chemicals.26 Investigations of industrial and occupational exposures showed high prevalence of lung cancer in workers in cobalt, bismuth, and nickel mines, whereas skin cancers in farmers and sailors were linked to chronic exposure to sunlight.27 Advances in bacteriology, especially the identification of bacteria and parasites as infection-causing organisms, led to a search for cancer-causing organisms. At the turn of the nineteenth century, an endless number of articles and monographs was published on cancer-causing microbes and parasites.28-30 Some investigators went as far as claiming that cancer cells were not epithelial cells but that they were parasites, coccidian.28 Of all these efforts, two parasites, Schistosoma haematobium31 and later on Clonorchis sinensis were proven to be related to bladder cancer and cancer of the bile ducts, respectively. The infection theory was also extended to viruses. Although numerous viruses were shown to produce tumors in experimental animals, the first virus, the Epstein–Barr virus linked to human cancer, was not discovered until 1964. As microscopic examination of cancer cells became routine laboratory procedure, it was inevitable that chromosomal anomalies, including asymmetry, were noticed.32 Within a decade, hereditary transmission of chromosomal changes was confirmed.33 In 1914, Theodor Boveri (1862-1915) was the first to propose34 that a change in the chromosomal constitution of cells is one of the prerequisites for malignant transformation of cells. He wrote that cancer cells almost always contain an abnormal chromosome complex. The abnormality is due to a defect that results in accelerated and abnormal nuclear division that is visible under the microscope as atypical, multipolar, mitosis. It was deducted that if alterations in the chromosomes were prerequisite to cancer, all that caused such changes, including radiation, were carcinogens. Indeed, within a few years after the discovery of the x-ray, the first radiation-induced carcinoma was reported on the hand of a technician.35 The first report was followed by voluminous literature on the subject. Most of the reported cases occurred in radiologists and were mostly carcinomas with a few leukemias and sarcomas. Similarly, within a decade after radium was isolated from uranium, irradiation-induced cancers began to appear.36 In 1911, Moritz Ribbert (1855-1920) of Germany introduced the theory that detachment of cells from each other by increased tissue tension, under external and internal stimuli, caused dislocation and uncontrolled growth of cells.37 James Ewing (1866-1943) of New York added to the above concept that this uncontrolled growth produced primitive, embryonic cells with unlimited potential.38 Ewing believed that local irritation can induce such an uncontrolled growth of cells, and he listed several examples, among which were carcinoma of the lower lip due smoking a clay pipe, oral carcinoma due to chewing of betel leaf mixed with tobacco and lime, esophageal carcinoma due to consumption of hot food and spices, skin carcinoma due to burns (from Kangris in natives of Kashmir), and carcinoma of the bladder and other organs due to chronic inflammation, fistulae, ulcers, trauma, stones, and parasites. Among toxic chemicals, he included arsenic and alcohol as carcinogens and pointed out that carcinoma of the lung occurs in workers who inhale tobacco dust in cigar factories and in the chromate industry. As to heredity's role in the etiology of cancer, Ewing felt there was much to be done, but he indicated that it seemed there were two kinds of heredity: direct transmission of the cancer itself with its abnormal antecedents and indirect transmission by transmission of enhanced liability to cancer. He warned that it would be a mistake to believe that the etiology of all cancers is the same. He found puzzling that active growth of cancer is occasionally interrupted by periods of relative or complete quiescence and questioned whether this periodicity in growth is due to changes in the life cycle of an oncogenic virus.38 In 1923, the first discussion was published on increased incidence of pulmonary cancer in cigarette smokers.39 As to brain tumors, theories of tissue tension, displaced heterotopic cells, increased vascularity, and neuroglial repair were entertained, but, ultimately, it was admitted that, when all had been said, the cause of growth of glial neoplasms remained unknown.40 Radioactivity in causation of osteosarcoma in luminescent-dial painters brought renewed interest in the danger of radiation.41 Before the 1920s ended, the importance of cells and their cytologic alterations in development of cancer were presented in a more concise way than ever before.42 The author emphasized that the cancer problem is mainly due to chromosomal changes in nuclei of cancer cells and to disruption of the normal connection between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. These phenomena expressed microscopically in many forms, including alteration in the nuclear–cytoplasmic ratio. It was suggested that frequent presence of lymphocytes around cancers may represent an unknown defense mechanism against cancer or that the lymphocytes may be carriers of the carcinogen. In 1931, James Ewing in his 87-page monograph on cancer43 devoted 30 pages to causation of cancer (Fig. 2). He wrote that it is a serious misconception to consider cancer a single disease. If there are multiple forms of cancer, he wrote, then there must be multiple causes. Ewing listed scores of known factors that may cause cancer and added a few new ones, injury to chromosomes, viruses, excessive secretion of sex hormones, increased fatty and mineral acids in the diet, foreign bodies and nonhealing wounds, constipation, hyperplasia and hypertrophy, loss of growth restraint in bone, polyps, papillomas, cysts, obesity, alkalosis of blood, and fumes from automobiles. In his concluding remarks, he underlined that experimental production of cancer has thrown much light on the origin of many cancers but has explained none of them completely, particularly not cancers in humans. Ewing was an invited lecturer at the London Cancer Conference in 1928. He presented his thoughts on ""The Causal and Formal Genesis of Cancer."" Part of his lecture was reproduced in a book dedicated to Ewing.44 Among the many things Ewing said, he indicated that the observed increase in cancer of the lung during recent years was highly suggestive of its correlation to the immense spread of cigarette-smoking habits. Within a year of the publication of Ewing's monograph,43 an entire book was published on primary carcinoma of the lung,45 shortly after cancer of the lung was linked to asbestosis.46 Title page of James Ewing's Causation, Diagnosis and Treatment of Cancer, 1931 (See Reference 43). Reprinted from the author's private collection. Leukemia, from the time the name was coined in 1845 by Rulph Virchow,20 was not regarded as cancer. This assumption was suddenly changed in 1938 by the publication of a book.47 The writer stated that although leukemia is widely distributed over the world and no races or groups of people are immune to it, almost nothing is known of the cause of leukemia, a disease that behaves like cancer. As to potential causes, the author listed unidentified infectious agents, excess or deficient formation of some essential substance in blood, or heredity by interaction of primary and associated genes. The role of heredity in genesis of cancers in general, and in particular in breast cancer, was reviewed48 in 1946. The author concluded that there are numerous inherited precancerous and cancerous conditions that are unequivocally linked with genetically determined genes. Among neoplasms with genetically transmitted genes, retinoblastoma, breast carcinoma, certain uterine and ovarian cancers, neurofibromatosis, and polyposis of the colon were listed. The aftermath of the Second World War heightened attention to radiation-induced cancer. Reports were documenting local and systemic damages including thorotrast injection-induced angiosarcoma of the liver,49 radiation-induced leukemia in radiologists,50 bone sarcomas in irradiated bones,51 and thyroid cancer in childhood and adolescence after radiation of enlarged thymus.52 Following prior leads,24, 39, 44 two articles appeared in 1950 that linked lung carcinoma to cigarette smoking.53, 54 The writers pointed out that although they found that cigarette smoking was closely related to carcinoma of the lung, no such association could be found in a group of patients with adenocarcinoma and that 32 percent of female lung cancer patients were nonsmokers53 (Table 1). Earlier references to chemical carcinogens followed in the 1950s, placing attention on intracellular, enzymatic changes in cancer cells.55 Also in the 1950s, advances in chemistry and biochemistry permitted specific identification of carcinogenic compounds in historically known carcinogens.56 Specific intranuclear alterations and chromosomal changes were noted in cancer cells during the last several decades before the 1950s,32-34, 42 but the technology to observe minute changes in chromosomes was lacking. In the 1960s, things changed for the better by the discovery of a small chromosome (that was later named the ""Philadelphia chromosome"") in leukemic cells from patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia.57 The discovery gave impetus to a relatively new field, cytogenetics. Of course, by everybody's admission, it remained to be resolved whether chromosomal changes were initiators of cancer or were just epiphenomena. Since 1960, a long list of proven and suspected cancer-causing chemical, physical, and biologic agents has been compiled. But an analysis of thoughts about causation of cancer after 1960 would be beyond the scope of this review, because anything that has occurred during the last five decades cannot be regarded as history.",0008-543X 1045-7410 1097-0142,-1,openalex,1611,,,,252

Methods Particular features of the methods were inflation of the estimates of numbers employed in occupations linked to COPD to account for retired or ex-workers whose exposure has ceased, and estimating attributable fraction (AF) by age, as COPD incidence increases with age. The link between age and duration of exposure, and time from cessation of exposure are accounted for by using unit relative risk (URR) estimates (annual change in COPD risk) or annual lung function decline. Where URRs are not available, risks are estimated by age based on assumptions about the age structure of a particular worker cohort. Results Using national data of numbers employed in occupations associated with raised COPD risk, matched to appropriate risk estimates and based on Levin's estimator, when mainly industry-based cross-sectional study risks were used, AFs for GB were estimated to be 11% for men and 3% for women. Alternatively using single population-based studies estimating risks by occupation or industry, AFs range from 6%-27% for men and 0%-5% for women. The probable reasons for the variability of the results are discussed, and an example is given of the additional impact of taking age into account in the estimation. Conclusions There is consistency between these initial estimates of occupational COPD attribution and previous estimates such as those from the American Thoracic Society. When data from the UK Biobank study becomes available, it is planned to further develop the AF by age methods to use with Miettinen's study based estimator.",1351-0711,-1,"embase, openalex","1103, 1766",,,,253
214,1674,Gloria Rachamin,2005,Patty's Toxicology,10.1002/0471435139.tox010,Use of Toxicological Data in Evaluating Chemical Safety,-,,,"More than 70,000 chemicals are currently registered in the chemical substances inventory under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) in the United States (U.S.), and every year new chemicals are introduced to the market. Each chemical can produce toxic effects that may be reversible or irreversible. Exposure to chemicals in the workplace can result in a wide range of adverse health outcomes, for example pulmonary disease skin irritation and sensitization, neurotoxicity, lung and liver function impairment, cancer, and hereditary diseases. Toxicological data provide the basis for evaluating the potential health risks of chemicals to humans. Information from human and animal studies is used to characterize the nature of the toxic effects of chemicals and to predict their risk to human health under given exposures. The ultimate goal of using data from such studies is to determine “safe” levels of human exposure to toxic substances. Because it is not possible to assure absolute safety to everyone for any chemical, “safe” does not imply risk‐free but a level of risk that is acceptable in our society. The purpose of this chapter is to provide an overview of the process of chemical safety evaluation in the context of the regulatory risk assessment paradigm from the perspective of occupational toxicology. Toxicological data from studies of the chemical in humans and animals, including physicochemical, toxicokinetic, and mechanistic data, are used in this evaluation. First, the adverse effects are identified and categorized by toxic end point. Next, the dose–response relationship for each end point is characterized, and the overall evidence is evaluated to determine the hazard class of the substance. If the toxicological database for a chemical is adequate, potential health risks to humans are then estimated, and exposure limits are derived by using risk assessment methodologies. Depending on the dose—response relationship (threshold or nonthreshold) of the adverse effect that is observed at the lowest dose (critical effect), three general risk assessment approaches can be applied: safety/uncertainty factor, low‐dose extrapolation risk model, and a unified benchmark dose approach. Note that various risk assessment procedures have been developed over the years and continue to evolve as science advances. A new terminology has also emerged in large part from environmental risk assessment work that focuses on community exposures to chemicals. Toxicological principles are an integral part of chemical risk assessment, so basic toxicological concepts and references are included.",,abstract_added,openalex,1674,,,,254
131,1601,Antti Karjalainen,1997,Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health,10.5271/sjweh.184,Asbestos -- a continuing concern,81-82,23,2,"Exposure to asbestos increases the risk of lung cancer, mesothelioma, pulmonary fibrosis (asbestosis), and various pleural diseases. Despite extensive research on the topic, the mechanisms of asbestos carcinogenicity are only partly understood. Two implications of this lack of knowledge are touched upon in this issue. Merler and his colleagues have reviewed the modalities of surveillance and health intervention for asbestos-exposed workers. Apart from the exposure and elimination of smoking, very few evidence-based tools seem to be available for reducing cancer mortality or promoting the health of exposed workers. In the other review Hillerdal & Henderson summarize the extensive literature dealing with the question of whether asbestos fibers as such, or asbestosis, is the reason for the increased risk of lung cancer. The question has 2 major practical implications: the strategies of primary prevention and the compensation for lung cancer among asbestos-exposed workers. The epidemiologic evidence of a causal relationship between asbestos exposure and mesothelioma is convincing and, despite the long latency time, some examples of successful prevention already exist. The incidence of mesothelioma has decreased in certain areas in the 1990s, but not everywhere (1, 2). In addition the statistics of the Finnish Cancer Registry indicate a plateau or a decline in the 1990s for men under 55 years of age and for women, while the incidence is still rising for men over 65 years of age (3). Up to 1995 the highest annual number of cases of mesothelioma was 57 in 1989. Meanwhile, the reporting of work-related cases has reached a high level, about 80% of all mesotheliomas in men. Preliminary data indicate possible modifying genetic and exogenous determinants for the asbestos-associated risk of mesothelioma (4, 5). Such findings may hopefully improve our understanding of the carcinogenic process, but eliminating the hazardous asbestos exposure remains the only effective means of prevention. Asbestos-related lung cancer is numerically even more important than mesothelioma. Hillerdal & Henderson point out that lung cancer is a common disease and even a low relative risk, if common, will result in a large number of lung cancers. The national policies vary in respect to whether the scientific evidence is considered to justify a total ban or the limited use of asbestos. The Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark were the first countries to implement a total ban. In the 1990s the same decision was made in Germany, Finland, and, quite recently, France. Meanwhile, the use of chrysotile asbestos is increasing in Asia and many other regions. It is to be expected that full control of exposure levels will be a difficult, if not impossible task in these societies. Surveillance and periodic medical examinations have an obvious social role in detecting and monitoring asbestos-associated occupational diseases, albeit their health benefits have not been evaluated. The risk of asbestos-associated diseases among exposed workers can be reduced by the elimination of asbestos exposure and the cessation of smoking, although Merler & his colleagues point out that more could perhaps be known, and better results achieved, if ongoing programs were integrated. Screening for lung cancer with X rays or sputum cytology is not considered beneficial. Nor do chemoprevention trials among asbestos-exposed workers so far indicate evidence of protection. In lung cancer screening studies, the number of lung cancer deaths in the screening group has been at least as high as in the reference group, and some chemoprevention trials have been interrupted due to adverse effects. There is a need for new early-diagnostic tools or new chemopreventive agents, but their application must be based on controlled trials. An important task in the surveillance of exposed workers is to provide them with adequate information on the health risks of asbestos. The right to know should be a self-evident principle. Motivation to avoid further exposure and to quit smoking is also enhanced by this information. On the other hand, one should not inspire fear in those who have been exposed. The provision of balanced and adequate information is a real challenge for those involved in the follow-up of exposed workers. In a Finnish screening campaign among construction and shipyard workers, the information given during the screening activities reduced the concern of the personal health risk of past exposure for 15% of those who were worried (6). For the rest, the concern increased or remained unchanged. The information aspect should not be forgotten when the details of future surveillance activities or health intervention is planned for exposed workers. Exposure intensity and the presence of pulmonary fibrosis are closely related, and epidemiologic studies will probably never lead to a scientific consensus on whether the fiber itself, the consequent fibrosis, or its progression is the reason for the increased risk of lung cancer. A better mechanistic understanding may reveal an independent role for each of these. Meanwhile, the compensation for lung cancer remains a controversial issue, from the point of view of both science and practice. Chest X-rays, high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and histology possess different sensitivities in detecting pulmonary fibrosis, and a medical differential diagnosis between (mild) asbestosis and other diffuse pulmonary fibrosis is not always simple. The sensitivity of CT instruments is continuously increasing, and there are no studies that have compared the occurrence of the various HRCT findings between asbestos-exposed and unexposed persons. If cumulative exposure and the relative risk of lung cancer, and not just the presence of fibrosis, are accepted as the basis for compensation, practical problems may arise from relatively low exposure and risks. When legal compensation is concerned, apportionment according to the estimated etiologic fractions of asbestos, tobacco smoking, and other lung carcinogens at the individual level is a justifiable solution. On the other hand, if the compensation for occupational diseases is integrated into the social security system, a dichotomous concept is reasonable. A system in which a varying part of an individual's social security comes from 1 source and the rest from another may cause problems. A relative risk of 2 is commonly used as a cut point for a dichotomous system. While the administrative basis for compensation is a political question, an abundance of scientific data is available to help to develop the actual criteria. A thorough exposure interview is often the best estimate of exposure. Reliable complementary information on the intensity of exposure and the consequent relative risk of lung cancer can be achieved by lung and bronchoalveolar lavage asbestos measurements, whereas recent Scandinavian studies confirm that the presence of pleural plaques as such indicate only a rather small relative risk of lung cancer, if any (7, 8). In the Finnish population, the risk of lung cancer was found to be 17-fold for asbestos sprayers, about 3-fold for insulators and asbestos quarry workers, 1.5-fold for plumbers, and 1.3-fold for construction carpenters. The exposure gradient behind this risk pattern was clearly reflected by the asbestos concentrations in pulmonary and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of workers in these occupations and unexposed referents. Finnish construction workers with long-term exposure to asbestos and pleural plaques as an occupational disease had a 1.2-fold risk of lung cancer. The surveillance of former asbestos workers and the compensation for asbestos-related cancers remain long-standing social challenges. Even though the occurrence of cancers may already have reached the maximum in some areas, the decline is unlikely to be rapid. This situation is unforgivable, as the basic knowledge for effective primary prevention was available already in the mid-1960s. Although the minimization of future exposures is the most important task, the concern for the health of past asbestos workers is an undeniable social responsibility. It should, however, not create the illusion that hazardous asbestos exposure is a past problem in modern societies. The quality of asbestos demolition work is a continuous problem, and a recent survey in Finland found occasional high fiber concentrations even inside the personal protectors during asbestos removal work. There is a need for continuous education and a more systematic health surveillance of asbestos demolition workers.",0355-3140 1795-990X,-1,openalex,1601,,,,255

ASCO and NCCN guidelines recognize this tradeoff and recommend targeted prophylactic use of colony stimulating factors (CSFs) to limit the risk of FN while maximizing the benefit of chemotherapy. This study sought to define current practice concerning these issues. Methods: Data were extracted from the records of 947 adult cancer subjects treated between 1/2007 and 2/2009 at a 29 center community oncology practice. Subjects >18 years with a primary tumor type of breast, ovary, colorectum, lung, or lymphoma were included. RDI was calculated by dividing the delivered dose intensity by that reported in the NCCN guideline regimens. FN risk was determined using the reported NCCN guideline regimen risk and the logistic regression FN model of Lyman et al. Results: The Table shows no significant difference between the mean RDI for subjects receiving or not receiving CSFs when stratified by NCCN regimen risk for low (p=0.871), intermediate (p=0.288), and high (p=0.106) risk subjects. When mean RDI was stratified by CSF use and Lyman model score, there was no significant difference between the RDI for low risk subjects (p=0.195); however, intermediate (p<0.001) and high (p<0.001) risk patients receiving CSFs had significantly higher mean RDIs than those who did not receive a CSF. Conclusions: These results suggest the delivered RDI is influenced by more than regimen risk and that CSF use leads to higher RDI in high-risk patients. However, despite guideline recommendations, the majority of patients in this study had their FN risk managed by dose reduction rather than by CSF use. The findings suggest that a model-guided strategy could allow clinicians to more consistently optimize RDI by using targeted CSF prophylaxis (though this needs further study to be verified).",0732-183X 1527-7755,abstract_added,openalex,1782,,,,256

Although recent treatments improve the quality of life of patients with mesothelioma, malignant pleural mesothelioma remains an aggressive disease.

Historically, there were relatively few measurements of the actual airborne asbestos fiber concentrations associated with the handling and shake out of such clothing in the home. In this chapter, six studies were evaluated that performed clothes-handling and shake-out events to simulate laundering events on work clothing contaminated with asbestos fibers during a variety of different conditions. The studies evaluated the potential for take-home or para-occupational exposure potential associated with both chrysotile and amphibole fibers, and evaluated the use of historic asbestos-containing products and raw asbestos fibers. The scenarios that were studied included both the loading of the clothing with fibers and the handling and shake-out of the clothing. Collectively, the studies allowed for an analysis of factors including the relationship between workplace and home exposure potential, the influence of ventilation on take-home exposure potential, the relationship between personal and bystander exposure potential during clothes-handling, a comparison of the concentrations of total airborne fibers to asbestos-specific airborne fibers, influences of fiber type on exposure potential, influences of clothing type on exposure potential, and the potential for fiber reentrainment in the home environment. The results indicated that the ratio of take-home exposure potential to workplace exposure potential was in the range of approximately 0.2–6.5%, depending on the study and its individual characteristics. In a number of instances, cumulative exposures associated with contaminated clothes-handling were also calculated and compared against established exposure and risk benchmarks. Overall, the published, peer-reviewed literature over the past 10 years has contributed significantly to our understanding of the potential for cumulative asbestos exposure and risk associated with clothes-handling and shake-out in a variety of scenarios.",,abstract_added,openalex,1691,,,,258

We continue to heartily encourage manuscripts from researchers across the globe. Topics in this issue reflect a variety of risk topics and risk processes within different settings. B. John Garrick was a pioneer in applying quantitative risk assessment to nuclear reactor safety.(1) In this article, he, along with John Stetkar and Paul Bembia, apply QRA to a low level radioactive waste management site in western New York State. The project is grounded in his work of three decades ago, and incorporates several newer tools and concepts. The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority used the QRA results to support a policy of continuing to use the disposal area. Recently, we have not published many articles that focus on occupational risks. Yet, this issue offers two interesting examples. Suresh Moolgavkar, Jay Turim, Dominik Alexander, Edmund Lau, and Colleen Cushing reexamined Libby vermiculite miners’ cohort data in order to estimate potency factors for lung cancer, mesothelioma, nonmalignant respiratory disease (NMRD), and all-cause mortality associated with exposure to Libby fibers. Partially supported by W. R. Grace, they used a time-dependent proportional hazards model. The results are similar to those previously obtained with the same data, and the estimated potency factors from their research will be the basis for a quantitative risk assessment at Libby. Funded by the Archer Daniels Midland Company, Patrick Sheehan, Kenneth Bogen, Jeffrey Hicks, Emily Goswami, Gregory Brorby, Edmund Lau, and Brian Ott examined occupational exposures to benzene in parts-washing operations. Using probabilistic estimating methods, they found that the exposure estimates are less than 10% of the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration permissible exposure limit of 1.0 ppm for benzene. Why are some people interested in preparing for hazard events and others not? Sıdıka Tekeli-Yesil, Necati Dedeoglu, Charlotte Braun-Fahrlaender, and Marcel Tanner sought an answer to this question in Istanbul, Turkey. Using a survey of over 1,100 people, they found multiple motivations for willingness to plan for an earthquake, including higher educational achievement, residing in a high earthquake risk area, having responded to an earthquake, more knowledge about earthquakes, home ownership, relatively young age, and other factors. The authors discuss the strategy of persuading motivated people to reach out to others. Mathew White and Branden Johnson add to our list of articles about risk and trust. The intuitive detection theorist (IDT) model of trust states that trust in hazard managers depends on their capacity to discriminate safe from dangerous situations (discrimination ability); assumption that danger is present when conditions are uncertain (response bias); and openness with the public about events (communication bias). They tested the model with experimental designs and found all three dimensions to be important correlates. The remaining papers focus on some common risk topics and processes. Dependence analysis assesses the influence of the failure of operators to perform one task on the failure probabilities of subsequent ones. Luca Podofillini, Vinh Dang, Enrico Zio, Piero Baraldi, and Massimo Librizzi build and demonstrate a fuzzy expert system model that is replicable, and the authors assert that this approach will make the process of examining and preventing cascading events more feasible. Motor vehicle accidents are of great concern to governments around the world. Using data from South Korea about accidents at railway-highway intersections for the years 1998–2002, Dominique Lord, Srinivas Reddy Geedipally, and Seth Guikema evaluated the performance of the COM-Poisson GLM. They found that it yielded better results than other options for these data. We have been publishing a good number of papers on models and strategies applicable to terrorism.

They found convincing evidence to support the conclusion that mesothelioma incidence is proportional to cumulative asbestos exposure. Conclusion The Collegium Ramazzini concludes that risk of malignant mesothelioma is proportional to cumulative exposure to asbestos in which all exposures - early as well as late - contribute to the totality of risk.

Methods: Among the 6,811,893 people who received health examinations from the Korean National Health Insurance Service, 969,351 ever-smokers (40–79 years) were included. Performance of Bach, Lung Cancer Risk Models for Screening, PLCOM2012, Pittsburgh, and Liverpool Lung Project models were evaluated. The ever-smokers were divided into the training and validation datasets by random sampling. The lung cancer risk model was developed and validated in the Korean population. The efficiency of model-based selection for lung cancer screening was compared with the eligible criteria of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST). Results: The Korean lung cancer risk model showed the area under the curve and expected/observed (E/ O) ratio of 0.816 and 0.983 in the training dataset and 0.816 and 0.988 in the validation dataset.

Methods and Results Burden of disease methodologies generally rely on the calculation of population attributable fraction (PAF). This in turn typically requires estimates of exposure prevalence and relative risk. An exposure surveillance system can provide the required estimate of exposure prevalence. Alternatively, PAF can be estimated if the incidence of the disease in the population, and the incidence of the disease in the unexposed, are known. Improved disease surveillance can make an important contribution in areas where exposure prevalence measures are not good and difficult to improve. Good estimates of disease that can reliably be connected to work (e.g. occupational asthma, occupational dermatitis) in specific study populations would allow the estimate of incidence in the unexposed if the incidence in the population was known. This approach would be more difficult in circumstances where the direct connexion to work is harder to establish (e.g. many musculoskeletal disorders and noise-induced hearing loss). Alternatively, since estimates of the incidence of the disease in the general population will often be available, probably the key area of additional information required would actually be the incidence in unexposed persons. This isn't the typical focus of occupational disease surveillance but could provide a useful contribution to the understanding of occupational disease and its burden on the community. Thirdly, surveillance systems that cover disorders that are virtually uniquely occupational, such as a register of cases of malignant mesothelioma, can provide a direct estimate of the number of cases of a particular occupational disorder. Conclusions Occupational surveillance systems can potentially contribute to estimations of burden of disease studies using several different approaches.",1351-0711,-1,embase,1102,,,,263

This approach could have considerable practical value for disease attribution in an era of decreasing exposure. However, a recent International Agency for Research on Cancer review concludes that the mechanism of production of asbestos-related lung cancer are unknown. Asbestosis, therefore, cannot be a biologically effective dose marker of lung cancer susceptibility. Asbestosis nonetheless would be useful in identifying asbestos-attributable lung cancer cases if it could be proven an infallible exposure indicator. In this study, we tested this hypothesis in the chrysotile miners and millers of Quebec, Canada. We examined exposure histories, autopsy records, and lung fiber content for 111 Quebec chrysotile miners and millers. If the hypothesis of an asbestosis requirement for lung cancer attribution were accurate, we would expect as asbestosis diagnosis to separate those with lung cancer and high levels of exposure from those with lower levels of exposure in a specific and sensitive manner. This is the first such study in which historical job-based individual estimates based on environmental measurements, lung fiber content, exposure timing, and complete pathology records including autopsies were available for review. We found significant excesses of lung tremolite and chrysotile and estimated cumulative exposure in those with lung cancer and asbestosis compared to those with lung cancer without asbestosis. However, when the latter were directly compared on a case-by-case basis, there was a marked overlap between lung cancer cases with and without asbestosis regardless of the measure of exposure. Smoking habits did not differ between lung cancer cases with and without asbestosis. In regression models, smoking pack-years discriminated between those with the without lung cancer, regardless of asbestosis status. Most seriously, the pathologic diagnosis of asbestosis itself seemed arbitrary in many cases. We conclude that although the presence of pathologically diagnosed asbestosis is a useful marker of exposure, the absence of this disease must be regarded as one of many factors in determining individual exposure status and disease causation.",0091-6765,-1,"pubmed, embase","1424, 1219",,,,264

A population-based case-control study including 437 incident cases and 874 controls was conducted from 1998 to 2002. Occupational and non-occupational asbestos exposure was assessed retrospectively by two expert hygienists. ORs of pleural mesothelioma for asbestos-exposed subjects compared to non-exposed subjects, and population-attributable risk (ARp) of asbestos exposure were estimated using a conditional logistic regression. A clear dose-response relationship was observed between occupational asbestos exposure and pleural mesothelioma (OR=4.0 (99% CI 1.9 to 8.3) for men exposed at less than 0.1 f/mL-year vs. 67.0 (99% CI 25.6 to 175.1) for men exposed at more than 10 f/mL-year). The occupational asbestos ARp was 83.1% (99% CI 74.5% to 91.7%) for men and 41.7% (99% CI 25.3% to 58.0%) for women. A higher risk of pleural mesothelioma was observed in subjects non-occupationally exposed to asbestos compared to those never exposed. The non-occupational asbestos ARp for these subjects was 20.0% (99% CI -33.5% to 73.5%) in men and 38.7% (99% CI 8.4% to 69.0%) in women. When considering all kinds of asbestos exposure, ARp was 87.3% (99% CI 78.9% to 95.7%) for men and 64.8% (99% CI 45.4% to 84.3%) for women. Our study suggests that the overall ARp in women is largely driven by non-occupational asbestos exposure arguing for the strong impact of such exposure in pleural mesothelioma occurrence. Considering the difficulty in assessing domestic or environmental asbestos exposure, this could explain the observed difference in ARp between men and women.",1468-3296,-1,"pubmed, embase","1342, 1096",,,,265

Qualitative and quantitative approaches will be contrasted. Method The IARC evaluation process typically employs summary level meta-data, in the form of systematic reviews, and pooled- and meta-analyses. Results IARC has heavily relied on published occupational epidemiological studies to identify specific carcinogens in the workplace and to form a scientific basis for the protection of workers worldwide. The evaluations of carcinogenic risk are made by international working groups of independent scientists and are qualitative in nature. Meta-analyses prepared for IARC working groups can complement the qualitative process and have been crucial in several instances; for example, in identifying sufficient evidence for lung and bladder cancer in painters and limited evidence for increased risk of bladder cancer among dry cleaners exposed to tetrachloroethylene and among professional drivers (bus, taxi, truck) with high exposure to outdoor air pollution. Since IARC does not provide recommendations for regulation or legislation, meta-relative risks can also be used to calculate attributable fractions to guide cancer control efforts, for agents in which a causal association is assumed and exposure prevalence has been well-characterised. Conclusions The IARC Monographs Programme is an authoritative source for the identification of carcinogenic hazards in the environment. Applying meta-analyses to the IARC process can be a useful tool for informing hazard identification and providing guidance for cancer control efforts.",1351-0711 1470-7926,-1,openalex,1736,,,,266

Environmental epidemiology is a relatively recent science, and because it deals with small numbers and exposures that cannot be assessed on individuals, it uses specific methods that are different from classical cancer epidemiology.3Pekkanen J Pearce N Environmental epidemiology: challenges and opportunities.Environ Health Perspect. 2001; 109: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar Pinheiro and Jin: “the proper indicator of risk in a population or a subpopulation is the incidence rate.” Although this is often true, it would be incorrect for this situation because most mesotheliomas are due to occupational exposure to asbestos,4Spirtas R Heineman EF Bernstein L et al.Malignant mesothelioma: attributable risk of asbestos exposure.Occup Environ Med. 1994; 51: 804-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar and therefore, the incidence (or mortality) rates reflect the process and/or use of asbestos in the studied area. Incidence rates cannot distinguish between occupational and environmentally caused mesotheliomas. Occupational exposure leads to a mesothelioma male:female (M:F) sex ratio of 4 to 8:1, with a mean age of diagnosis of 74 years old, because of the 30 to 50 years latency between initial exposure and mesothelioma development. In places where people were only environmentally exposed to carcinogenic fibers, the M:F sex ratio is about 1:1 and the mean age of diagnosis is 50 to 60 years.5Baris YI Sahin AA Ozesmi M et al.An outbreak of pleural mesothelioma and chronic fibrosing pleurisy in the village of Karain/Urgüp in Anatolia.Thorax. 1978; 33: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Baumann F Maurizot P Mangeas M Ambrosi JP Douwes J Robineau B Pleural mesothelioma in New Caledonia: associations with environmental risk factors.Environ Health Perspect. 2011; 119: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Bruno C Tumino R Fazzo L et al.Incidence of pleural mesothelioma in a community exposed to fibres with fluoro-edenitic composition in Biancavilla (Sicily, Italy).Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2014; 50: 111-118PubMed Google Scholar In places where both types of exposure exist, the M:F sex ratio decreases and the proportion of young (<55 years old) cases increases, compared with places with occupational exposure only. Consequently, we used the significant decrease of mesothelioma M:F sex ratio and the increase of young cases as indicators of possible environmental exposure to carcinogenic fibers. Pinheiro and Jin: “there is no scientific consensus on the use of the sex ratio and the proportion under 55 as indicators of environmental (non-occupational) exposure to asbestos or NOA.” The epidemiology of mesothelioma from mixed environmental and occupational exposures to carcinogenic fibers has never specifically been studied. However, the studies of populations exposed to carcinogenic fibers from their natural environment, without occupational exposure to asbestos, showed a mesothelioma M:F sex ratio of about 1:1 and a higher proportion of young cases.5Baris YI Sahin AA Ozesmi M et al.An outbreak of pleural mesothelioma and chronic fibrosing pleurisy in the village of Karain/Urgüp in Anatolia.Thorax. 1978; 33: 181-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar, 6Baumann F Maurizot P Mangeas M Ambrosi JP Douwes J Robineau B Pleural mesothelioma in New Caledonia: associations with environmental risk factors.Environ Health Perspect. 2011; 119: 695-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 7Bruno C Tumino R Fazzo L et al.Incidence of pleural mesothelioma in a community exposed to fibres with fluoro-edenitic composition in Biancavilla (Sicily, Italy).Ann Ist Super Sanita. 2014; 50: 111-118PubMed Google Scholar There are no published studies contradicting or questioning the methodology we used. The first International Conference on Mesothelioma in Populations Exposed to Naturally Occurring Asbestiform Fibers sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), and International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), will be held in Honolulu, November 9–10; methodology will be one of the topics discussed. We would welcome Drs. Pinheiro and Jin. Pinheiro and Jin: “a male to female sex ratio can be elevated just by virtue of a low number of male cases rather than an actual increased absolute number among females.” Although this statement appears incorrect—M:F would be elevated by an increase in males and /or a decrease in females—we think we understand what they mean. However, a lower mesothelioma incidence/mortality in male and in old age groups simply reflects a lower occupational exposure to asbestos. In the absence of environmental exposure, a low level of occupational exposure leads to a lower mesothelioma incidence in both males and females, and in both old and young age groups, with a M:F sex ratio still around 4 to 8:1, and less than 10% of mesothelioma cases in young individuals. If there is environmental exposure in a region where a low level of occupational exposure exists, the environmental exposure causes additional mesothelioma cases in both males and females, leading to a decreased sex ratio and increased proportion of young mesothelioma cases—as observed in Southern Nevada, whereas the total incidence in male and in old age groups may still be low compared with regions with higher occupational exposure. Pinheiro and Jin question why the study periods are different in the incidence data that we used to compare mesothelioma incidence by state and the mortality data that we analyzed by gender, age group, and county. The answer is simple: the incidence data that we used are public, available by state only, and 2006–2010 was the longest available period of time, while the Center for Disease Control (CDC) mesothelioma mortality data that we obtained to carry out our analysis by county were available for 1999–2010. In addition, we merely cited the U.S. states that presented the lowest and highest mesothelioma incidence in the US, the lowest and highest sex ratio, and the lowest and highest proportion of young adults. We did not make any statistical comparison using these numbers, which were given as examples; we did not give any p value comparing Nevada and any of the seven states cited in Table 2.1Baumann F Buck BJ Metcalf RV McLaurin BT Merkler DJ Carbone M The presence of asbestos in the natural environment is likely related to mesothelioma in young individuals and women from Southern Nevada.J Thorac Oncol. 2015; 10: 731-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar We thank Pinheiro and Jin for highlighting the erroneous total number of mesotheliomas in Table 2.1Baumann F Buck BJ Metcalf RV McLaurin BT Merkler DJ Carbone M The presence of asbestos in the natural environment is likely related to mesothelioma in young individuals and women from Southern Nevada.J Thorac Oncol. 2015; 10: 731-737Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar Curiously, they also made a mistake: 31,408 + 133 = 31,541 instead of 31,545 as they stated. Pinheiro and Jin: “For the immediately younger (0–49) and older age groups (0–59) the risk in Nevada is fundamentally the same as in the US,” suggesting that only the 0 to 54 years old group would be different. But their own Table 1 shows higher risk in Nevada for the 0 to 59 years old group and higher risk in the 0 to 49 years old group for Southern Nevada, compared with the US. In addition, because of the small numbers, their 95% confidence intervals are large and do not allow for any significant comparison. Consequently, incidence/mortality rates clearly cannot be used to measure environmental exposures. Pinheiro and Jin graciously comment “We praise Baumann for producing a body of literature on mesothelioma and exposure to natural-occurring asbestos (NOA). The recent discovery of NOA in Southern Nevada has raised our interest in the surveillance of mesothelioma in the region.” So it appears we all agree that our findings identifying environmental exposure to asbestos in Southern Nevada are important and require follow-up because asbestos causes mesothelioma. Therefore, we are puzzled by the title of their letter, a title that cannot be supported by data, and that in fact contradicts published evidence that exposure to asbestos increases the risk of mesothelioma and that such exposure is occurring in Southern Nevada.8Buck BJ Goossens D Metcalf RV et al.Naturally occurring asbestos, potential for human exposure, Southern Nevada, USA.Soil Sci Soc Am J. 2013; 77: 2192-2204Crossref Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 9Metcalf RV Buck BJ Genesis and health risk implications of an unusual occurrence of fibrous NaFe3+-amphibole.Geology. 2015; 43: 63-66Crossref Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 10Tetra Tech Final Phase 1 site characterization report for Boulder City Bypass naturally occurring asbestos (NOA) project phase 1 (Railroad Pass to Silverline Road).Accessible at: http://www.nevadadot.com/uploadedFiles/NDOT/Micro-Sites/BoulderCityBypass/NOS/Final_NDOT_Phase_I_Report-10-6-14.pdfDate: 2014Google Scholar Risk is defined as the product of hazard and vulnerability (or exposure).11Stein S Stein J Playing against Nature: Integrating Science and Economics to Mitigate Natural Hazards in an Uncertain World. 1st Ed.

The challenge is to construct reliable risk prediction models to identify that fraction of smokers most likely to get lung cancer. High-risk individuals could undergo a program of screening surveillance that might not be appropriate for a lower risk population and receive the most intensive smoking cessation interventions. Models with improved discriminatory ability will also have clinical benefits. In the US, 150,000 patients are diagnosed with focal pulmonary lesions annually, with the prevalence of malignancy ranging from 10 to 70%. Current guidelines are to employ best clinical judgment and/or validated models. Finally, risk prediction tools could be incorporated into the design of smaller, more powerful, and “smarter” prevention trials. Cardiovascular and type 2 diabetes risk profiles using epidemiologic data have been effectively used for nearly two decades. In the cancer arena, risk prediction models for breast cancer have the longest history, although models have also been generated for prostate, lung, melanoma, ovary, colorectal, and bladder cancers. The advent of genome-wide association studies to identify low-penetrance common susceptibility alleles now heralds the possibility of incorporating panels of gene variants into existing models and to assess improvement in model performance. However, to date, the expanded models for many cancer sites have shown only modest incremental improvements in discrimination. Lung Risk Models: We and others have explored various approaches for lung cancer prediction. Such tools hold promise, but their interpretation is complex. Epidemiologic/clinical: Bach published the original risk prediction model based on data from the Carotene and Retinol Efficacy Trial (CARET) of 14,000 heavy smokers and >4,000 asbestos-exposed men, mostly white (1). The variables included age, gender, asbestos exposure, smoking history, cigarettes per day, duration of smoking and of cessation. The Bach model has been validated in an independent data from the placebo arm of the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention study. Our baseline model was based on data derived from an ongoing lung cancer case control study (2). Variables included were environmental tobacco smoke (for never and former smokers only), family cancer history, asbestos and dust exposures, prior respiratory disease, history of hay fever, and smoking history variables. All variables have strong biologically plausible etiologic roles, and are relatively easy to ascertain through patient interview. The validated area under the curve (AUC) statistics for the former and current smoker models were modest (0.63, and 0.58, respectively), although consistent with those from other risk prediction models. If age and smoking status (case-control matching variables) had been included in the models, the models would likely have performed far better. The Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) variables (3) include smoking duration, prior diagnosis of pneumonia, occupational exposure to asbestos, prior cancer diagnosis and family history of lung cancer. Most recently a carefully constructed model based on data from 70,962 control subjects in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian cancer screening trial (PLCO) was published (4). This model includes age, SES (education), BMI, family history of lung cancer, COPD, recent chest x-ray, smoking status (never, former, or current), pack-years smoked, and smoking duration. A second model also included smoking quit-time. External validation was performed with 44,223 PLCO intervention arm participants. In the external validation sample, models 1 and 2 had area under the curves of 0.841 and 0.784, respectively. These models had high discrimination in women, men, whites, and nonwhites. Extended Models: Functional Data: We have estimated the improvement in model performance by incorporating two measures of DNA repair capacity that have been shown in case-control analyses to be associated with increased lung cancer risk (5). Addition of the biomarker assays does improve the sensitivity of the models over epidemiologic and clinical data alone. These in vitro lymphocyte culture assays, however, are time-consuming and require some level of technical expertise. Therefore while feasible in a controlled academic setting, they are not applicable for widespread population-based implementation. Genetic Data: Genetic data are stable, inexpensive to ascertain, accurate and amenable to high-throughput analysis. However, it remains uncertain whether enriched multimarker models give better discrimination. We have added three SNPS that were most significant in GWAS of lung cancer to the baseline lung epidemiologic model. These include a replicated SNP in the 15q25 chromosomal region that encompasses the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor subunit genes, CHRNA3 and CHRNA5, that have a defined role in nicotine dependence, and a hypothesized direct role in downstream signaling pathways that promote carcinogenesis. We also included two SNPs from the 5p15.33 locus (rs2736100 and rs401681) that contains two known genes: the TERT (human telomerase reverse transcriptase) gene and the CLPTM1L. The AUC showed only modest improvement. Such small increases in discriminative accuracy are unlikely to be of diagnostic or predictive utility. Young (6) developed a risk model using a 20-SNP panel including metabolizing, inflammation, DNA repair, anti-oxidant, apoptosis and addiction genes. The final model included the 20 SNPs, age, history of COPD, family history of lung cancer and gender. When numeric scores were assigned to both the SNP and demographic data, and sequentially combined by a simple algorithm in a risk model, the composite score was found to be linearly related to lung cancer risk with a bimodal distribution. Spira et al (7) have advanced the notion that upper airway gene expression in smokers may serve as a relatively noninvasive surrogate marker of the physiologic response of the lung to tobacco smoke and could be used in large-scale screening and chemoprevention studies for lung cancer. Gene expression profiles in cytologically normal large airway epithelium were obtained via bronchoscopic brushings and were predictive of cancer status in a combined clinicogenomic model (P < 0.005). There was a significant improvement in performance of the clinicogenomic relative to the clinical model (P < 0.05). Use of the clinicogenomic model may reduce invasive diagnostic procedures for individuals without lung cancer. The ROC curve may not be sensitive to differences in probabilities between models, and therefore insufficient to assess the impact of adding a new predictor. A substantial gain in performance may not yield a substantial increase in AUC, and only a very large independent association of the new marker with risk will yield a meaningful larger AUC. As an example, the Framingham Risk Score that is widely applied has an AUC of about 0.80. New metrics need to be developed to compare nested models. In summary, the ability to accurately predict risk of lung cancer among former and current smokers has public health, clinical and financial implications for primary prevention, surveillance programs, screening programs and chemoprevention trials.",1078-0432 1557-3265,abstract_added,openalex,1763,,,,268

Landi",2012,International Journal of Epidemiology,10.1093/ije/dys193,Authors' response to: Qualitative job-exposure matrix--a tool for the quantification of population-attributable fractions for occupational lung carcinogens?,357-358,42,1,"We thank Taeger et al. for their comments1 on our article.2 We take this opportunity to clarify some important points on the use of job-exposure matrices (JEMs) in occupational epidemiology. We agree that quantitative JEMs are a fundamental tool for estimating exposure–response associations. However, when the aim is to estimate the impact of selected carcinogens on cancer burden, we, as others,3–5 believe a semi-quantitative JEM is fully appropriate.With regard to specific criticisms, Taeger et al. firstly express concern over the discrepancy between the Population Attributable Fraction (PAF) for exposure to asbestos, crystalline silica and nickel-chromium estimated with the DOM-JEM (22.5%) and the one reported using a classic job-title approach in our previous article (4.9%).6 As we stated in our article, this discrepancy should not be surprising. We re-emphasize that it was an expected finding due to the higher sensitivity of a JEM, as a method of exposure assessment, compared with the A and B lists approach, which accounts for all known high-risk jobs for lung cancer, but not for all jobs with exposure to lung carcinogens.Secondly, Taeger et al. stated that the lack of timescale and industry or country stratification in our study is a potential source of bias. Although there is a general decrease in exposure levels over time, this is mainly in absolute levels. The relative ranking of jobs in terms of exposure intensity will most likely not change over time, nor will it differ between countries. As such, we are convinced that the DOM-JEM does not result in a high rate of false positives. When constructing the DOM-JEM, we opted for specificity by taking probability of exposure explicitly into account.7 With regard to industry, most International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) 1968 codes are uniquely nested within industry, and industry as such was considered within DOM-JEM. Regarding the criticism of Taeger et al. that our use of the DOM-JEM semi-quantitative score years to estimate the individual cumulative exposure was incorrect, we should recall that the common definition of cumulative exposure in the literature is ‘the product of average exposure intensity and exposure duration’.8 We assigned values of 0, 1 and 4 to the exposure intensity scores of none, low and high exposure to reflect the log-normal (multiplicative) nature of occupational exposure concentrations, so although we use arbitrary units, they reflect an appropriate spacing of the exposure groups, and the results can thus be viewed as cumulative exposure metrics.Thirdly, Taeger et al. argue that the prevalence of some occupational carcinogens in our study was ‘unrealistically high on a population level’, in particular for asbestos exposure. They assert that this ‘overestimated prevalence’ signifies either that the study sample is not representative of the general population or that the JEM is biased. As stated in our article, the DOM-JEM had already been validated in comparison with other JEMs and individual expert assessments in previous international studies.9,10 In fact, a recent study comparing the reliability of retrospective exposure assessment tools showed the DOM-JEM to have the highest level of agreement with the expert assessment for asbestos and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among all the JEMs evaluated.11 Moreover, the assertion that our prevalence estimates are ‘unrealistically high’ is at odds with the evidence of previous similar studies, whose estimates were similar to or even higher than our own. For instance, in the multicentre population-based case-control study coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in four European countries including Italy, Berrino et al.12 estimated, among men enrolled in 1979–1982, using a JEM developed ad hoc, a prevalence of exposure to asbestos of 46.4% among controls and 68.3% among cases, compared with 32.2% and 41.1%, respectively, using the DOM-JEM in our study. When, as an exercise, we applied this ad hoc JEM to the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study population, the estimated exposure prevalence to asbestos was 39.5% among controls and 51.2% among cases. More recently, a German population-based case-control study that used an expert assessment approach reported among men enrolled in 1988–1993 a prevalence of asbestos exposure almost identical to ours, 33.6% among controls and 41.0% among cases.13 One further point of note is that Lombardy, even in the absence of shipbuilding and railroad repair industries, ranks fourth among Italian regions for incidence rates of pleural malignant mesothelioma,14 providing indirect evidence of the high frequency of exposure to asbestos (banned only recently, in 1992) in the study region.Finally, Taeger et al. claim that our ‘overestimated prevalence estimates rather bias the PAF in an upward direction’. First of all, as just stated, our prevalence estimates are not inflated. Secondly, even if that were the case, we should remember that the PAF is based on the ratio of the difference between crude incidence rates between exposed and unexposed, divided by the crude incidence rate in the exposed. So, as long as the incidence rate in the unexposed is not underestimated, the PAF will not be overestimated.3 Even if the DOM-JEM specificity is inevitably <100% (despite care in not assigning exposure to workers unlikely to be exposed or whose likely exposure is trivial), the PAF will not be biased.3In summary, the available data indicate that our exposure estimates obtained with the DOM-JEM are not abnormally elevated and there is no reason to doubt the representativeness of our study base, which included incident cases and randomly sampled (from regional databases) population controls and obtained elevated participation rates. Therefore, our conclusion of an overall PAF of 22.5% for exposure to asbestos, crystalline silica and nickel-chromium is a fair estimate of the impact of these occupational carcinogens on lung cancer risk in this study population.2",0300-5771 1464-3685,-1,openalex,1663,,,,270

However, the potential long-term health effects have not been well established across different exposure situations. We studied 74,040 workers who worked at 29 metal mines and pottery factories in China for 1 y or more between January 1, 1960, and December 31, 1974, with follow-up until December 31, 2003 (median follow-up of 33 y). We estimated the cumulative silica dust exposure (CDE) for each worker by linking work history to a job-exposure matrix. We calculated standardized mortality ratios for underlying causes of death based on Chinese national mortality rates. Hazard ratios (HRs) for selected causes of death associated with CDE were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. The population attributable risks were estimated based on the prevalence of workers with silica dust exposure and HRs. The number of deaths attributable to silica dust exposure among Chinese workers was then calculated using the population attributable risk and the national mortality rate. We observed 19,516 deaths during 2,306,428 person-years of follow-up. Mortality from all causes was higher among workers exposed to silica dust than among non-exposed workers (993 versus 551 per 100,000 person-years). We observed significant positive exposure-response relationships between CDE (measured in milligrams/cubic meter-years, i.e., the sum of silica dust concentrations multiplied by the years of silica exposure) and mortality from all causes (HR 1.026, 95% confidence interval 1.023-1.029), respiratory diseases (1.069, 1.064-1.074), respiratory tuberculosis (1.065, 1.059-1.071), and cardiovascular disease (1.031, 1.025-1.036). Significantly elevated standardized mortality ratios were observed for all causes (1.06, 95% confidence interval 1.01-1.11), ischemic heart disease (1.65, 1.35-1.99), and pneumoconiosis (11.01, 7.67-14.95) among workers exposed to respirable silica concentrations equal to or lower than 0.1 mg/m(3). After adjustment for potential confounders, including smoking, silica dust exposure accounted for 15.2% of all deaths in this study. We estimated that 4.2% of deaths (231,104 cases) among Chinese workers were attributable to silica dust exposure. The limitations of this study included a lack of data on dietary patterns and leisure time physical activity, possible underestimation of silica dust exposure for individuals who worked at the mines/factories before 1950, and a small number of deaths (4.3%) where the cause of death was based on oral reports from relatives. Long-term silica dust exposure was associated with substantially increased mortality among Chinese workers. The increased risk was observed not only for deaths due to respiratory diseases and lung cancer, but also for deaths due to cardiovascular disease.

Influencing factors on cardiovascular health Tobacco use The smoking prevalence among Chinese residents has shown a downward trend. According to the Chinese Adult Tobacco Survey in 2018, the current smoking prevalence among Chinese residents ≥15 years of age was 26.6%, which was higher in rural areas (28.9%) than in urban areas (25.1%), and the daily consumption by each smoker was 16.0 cigarettes on average. The highest prevalence was found in the 45 to 64 age group (30.2%), while the lowest was among people with college education or above (20.5%). According to the Global Youth Tobacco Survey (GYTS)-China 2014, the overall prevalence of tobacco use among Chinese adolescents was 6.9%. It was higher among boys (11.2%) than girls (2.2%) in junior high school, and higher in rural areas (7.8%) than in cities (4.8%). The proportion of attempt to smoke in students was 18.8%, 28.9% for boys and 7.7% for girls. The top 3 provinces with the highest prevalence of smoking were Tibet (19.0%), Yunnan (16.1%), and Guizhou (14.9%). In general, the rate of second-hand smoke exposure among non-smokers in China has been declining, with 72.4% in 2010 and 68.1% in 2018. And 35.5% were exposed to second-hand smoke almost every day, 44.9% of the respondents reported seeing someone smoking in their own homes, 50.9% of indoor workers witnessed people smoking in their workplaces. Internet cafes (89.3%), bars and nightclubs (87.5%), and restaurants (73.3%) were the most common indoor public places with severe exposure to second-hand smoke. The proportion of non-smokers who witnessed smoking in coffee shops and teahouses, universities, government buildings, medical and health institutions, taxis, primary and secondary schools, and public transport were 48.4%, 33.3%, 31.1%, 24.4%, 23.5%, 23.4%, and 12.9%, respectively. In 2018, 86.0% of the people believed that smoking could cause serious diseases. The awareness rates of specific diseases caused by smoking ranked from high to low were lung cancer (82.8%), heart disease (50.8%), stroke (41.4%), and impotence (26.0%). And 20.1% of the people realized that smoking was a common trigger for all the above 4 diseases, 71.4% of the people thought that second-hand smoke would cause serious diseases. The awareness of these diseases ranked from high to low as children lung disease (66.7%), adult lung cancer (65.8%), and adult heart disease (39.7%). And 36.1% of the people knew that second-hand smoke was the common cause for all the above 3 diseases. In 2015, the prevalence of smoking cessation among Chinese smokers was 18.7%. In 2018, it increased to 20.1%, lower in men (19.6%) than in women (30.2%). There was no significant difference between urban (20.0%) and rural areas (20.3%). The prevalence of smoking cessation in young age group was relatively low. Cigarette smoking and exposure to second-hand smoke is one of the major preventable risk factors for death of adults in China. The relative risk (RR) of death associated with cigarette smoking in Chinese population was 1.23 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.18–1.27), and the population attributable risk (PAR) was 7.9%. The RR was 1.18 (95% CI: 1.13–1.23) among men and 1.27 (95% CI: 1.19–1.34) among women. The PAR was 10.0% among men and 3.5% among women. Healthy diet During the 30 years from 1982 to 2012, the main diet pattern in Chinese residents changed significantly. It was characterized by the facts that the intake of refined grains and whole grains decreased, especially the coarse cereals. The intake of animal products and edible oil increased significantly. The amount of salt and soy sauce used in family cooking decreased, but the salt intake was still as high as 10.5 g/day. The intake of fresh vegetables was decreasing. Although the fruit intake in 2012 was higher than that in 1982, it also showed a downward trend compared with 1992 and 2002. The daily per capita intake of fruit was less than 50 g. China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) had been conducted 4 times during 1982 to 2012. The results showed that the energy intake from dietary fat was rising in Chinese residents, with the national average of 32.9% in 2012, which exceeded the upper limit recommended by dietary guidelines (recommended range: 20%–30%); while that from carbohydrates decreased significantly, with the national average of 55% in 2012, which dropped to the lower limit of recommendation (recommended range: 55%–65%). According to data of CHNS 2010 to 2012, among all dietary factors attributable to the deaths from cardiovascular metabolic diseases, high sodium intake (>2 g/day, accounting for 17.3%) ranked first, followed by inadequate intake of fruits (<300 g/day, 11.5%), omega-3 fatty acids (<250 mg/day, 9.7%), nuts (<250 mg/day, 8.2%), whole grains (<125 g/day, 8.1%), and vegetables (<400 g/day, 7.3%). According to the data of CHNS in 1982, 1992, 2002, and 2010 to 2012, the PAR of dietary factors for the mortality of cardiovascular metabolic diseases in Chinese adults decreased. The PAR of 12 dietary factors decreased from 62.2% in 1982 to 51.0% in 2012. However, with the increase and aging of population, the deaths from cardiovascular metabolic diseases caused by unhealthy diet still rose, from 1.07 million in 1982 to 1.51 million in 2010 to 2012. From 2010 to 2012, the prevalence of alcohol drinking (the proportion of people who drank alcohol in the past 12 months to the total population) in the Chinese residents aged ≥15 years was 34.3%, which was 13.3% higher than that in 2002. The average daily alcohol intake among drinkers was 28.1 g, 1.6 g more than that in 2002. The prevalence of excessive alcohol intake (>25 g/day for men and >15 g/day for women) was 30.4%. A prospective cohort study of chronic diseases in China recruited 512,715 adults from 2004 to 2007. After 10-year follow-up, the result revealed that alcohol was responsible for about 8% of ischemic strokes and 16% of intracerebral hemorrhage. Genotype-predicted mean alcohol intake had a positive association with stroke, which was stronger for intracerebral hemorrhage, but not significantly associated with myocardial infarction (MI). Two drinks a day (100 g alcohol/week) was associated with an increased risk of stroke by 10% to 15% and a slightly elevated incidence of hypertension, while 4 drinks a day (280 g alcohol/week) increased the risk of stroke by about 35%. According to the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016, the current drinker prevalence for Chinese men was 48%, and the average of daily alcohol intake was 33 g. The deaths attributable to alcohol reached 650,000, accounting for 9.8% of total deaths, and the attributable disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) were 20 million. The current drinker prevalence for Chinese women was 16%, and the average of daily alcohol intake was 2.4 g. The deaths attributable to alcohol reached 59,000, accounting for 1.2% of total deaths, and the attributable DALYs were 1.7 million, accounting for 1.6% of total DALYs. Physical activity Physical Activity and Fitness in China—The Youth Study was conducted in Chinese school-aged children and adolescents in 2016 and 2017, respectively. Multi-stage cluster sampling method was used to recruit 120,000 to 130,000 students from primary and secondary schools across all administrative provinces in the mainland of China. In 2017, 34.1% students met the physical activity guidelines, which was slightly higher than that in 2016. In 2016, the prevalences of screen viewing time ≥2 hours on TV, mobile phone, and computer among primary and secondary school students were 8.7%, 11.5%, and 9.0%, respectively, on weekdays, while they increased to 23.7%, 27.7%, and 17.5%, respectively, on weekends. The prevalences were higher in boys than in girls. The prevalences of screen viewing time ≥2 hours in urban students were lower than their rural counterparts on weekdays, but they were higher on weekends, except for that of watching TV. According to CHNS, the total physical activity of Chinese adults fell from 385.9 MET h/7 days in 1991 to 212.8 MET·h/7 days in 2009. The occupational physical activity decreased by 31% in men from 1991 to 2011, while the trend in women was similar. Chinese adults’ time spent in sedentary behaviours increased from 15.1 hours per week in 1991 to 20.0 hours per week in 2009. This survey also predicted that the total physical activity of Chinese adults will continue to drop to 200.1 MET·h/7 days by 2020 and 188.5 MET·h/7 days by 2030, while the time spent in sedentary behaviours will increase to 22.7 hours per week and 25.2 hours per week, respectively [Figure 1].Figure 1: Trend of physical activity amount among Chinese adults from 1991 to 2030.According to Report on Chronic Diseases Risk Factor Surveillance in China, the time spent in sedentary behaviours among adults aged ≥18 years increased from 2.7 h/day in 2010 to 3.3 h/day in 2013. The increase in urban areas was greater than that in rural areas, while it was similar between men and women. National Physical Fitness Surveillance showed that, in 2014, the prevalence of regular physical activity was 33.9% among Chinese residents and 14.7% in those aged ≥20 years, of which, more urban citizens engaged in activity (19.5%) than rural population (10.4%). The lowest prevalence was in the group aged 20 to 39 years, while the highest in those aged 60 to 69. The China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB) study conducted an average 7.5 years of follow-up among more than 487,000 subjects with no prior cardiovascular diseases (CVD) history at baseline. Total physical activity was inversely associated with the risk of CVD death, which was decreased by 41% (hazard ratio (HR)=0.59, 95% CI: 0.55–0.64) in the top quintile of baseline total physical activity (33.8 MET·h/day) as compared with that in the bottom quintile (9.1 MET·h/day). A 4 MET·h/day higher level of physical activity was associated with a 12% lower risk of CVD death. The strength of this association was similar for occupational and non-occupational physical activity. A global economic analysis of disease burden estimated that, in 2013, the total health-care costs of physical inactivity were almost $4.86 billion in China, accounting for 10% of the global costs. The direct and indirect costs was $1.78 billion and $3.08 billion, respectively. The proportion of costs borne by households, public and private sectors was 33.90%, 55.80%, and 10.30%, respectively. Overweight and obesity Chinese National Survey on Students Constitution and Health was conducted 6 times during 1985 to 2014. More than 200,000 students aged 7 to 18 years were enrolled in each survey. Overweight and obesity were determined by the body mass index (BMI) percentile criteria of Working Group on Obesity in China. The prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese adolescents increased continuously. It was 19.4% among 7 to 18 year-old children in 2014. The prevalence of overweight and obesity in 2014 was 11 and 56 times of that in 1985, respectively [Figure 2].Figure 2: Trends of overweight and obesity rates among Chinese adolescents (7–18 years old).According to the Comprehensive Report on Nutrition and Health Status of Chinese Residents (2010–2013), the prevalence of overweight and obesity among Chinese adults aged ≥18 years reached 30.1% and 11.9%, respectively, in 2012. It was increased by 32.0% and 67.6%, respectively, when compared with the data in 2002. The increase in rural areas was higher than that in cities. China Hypertension Survey (CHS) was conducted in 441,306 residents aged ≥18 years from 31 provinces in China from 2012 to 2015. The prevalence of abdominal obesity (waist circumference ≥90 cm for men and ≥85.0 cm for women) was 29.1% (28.6% in men and 29.6% in women). The number of adults with abdominal obesity was estimated to be 277.8 million. The CKB study found that maintaining a normal BMI was associated with a reduction in the risk of major coronary events by 5.8%, ischemic heart disease (IHD) by 7.8%, ischemic stroke by 4.5%, and type 2 diabetes by 34.4%, respectively. Using BMI < 24.0 kg/m2 as the low-risk definition, 36.0% of the incident diabetes could be attributed to overweight/obesity. Compared with normal waist circumference (<85.0 cm for men and <80.0 cm for women), central obesity (waist circumference ≥90.0 cm for men and ≥85.0 cm for women) was associated with an increase in the risk of IHD by 29%, major coronary event by 30%, and IHD death by 32%. In 2017, high BMI accounted for 590,000 CVD deaths in China. The age-standardized mortality of CVD due to high BMI was 31.5/100,000, and 13.5% of CVD deaths was attributed to high BMI. In 2003, the total medical cost attributable to overweight and obesity in China was estimated at ¥21.11 billion, accounting for 25.5% of the total medical costs of the 4 chronic diseases: hypertension, coronary heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and stroke. In 2010, overweight and obesity imposed a substantial economic burden of ¥90.768 billion on China, which was responsible for 42.9% of the costs of the 5 major chronic diseases: hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, stroke, and cancer, and accounted for 4.5% of the national health expenditure. Mental health According to the data from cardiovascular outpatients of tertiary general hospitals of 5 Chinese cities in 2014, the adjusted prevalence rate of depressive and anxiety disorder was 4.05%, the depressive and/or anxiety disorder was 14.27%. The adjusted prevalence of lifetime depressive and anxiety disorder (ie, the proportion of current and previous patients in the total recruited subjects) was 5.37%, depressive and/or anxiety disorder was 16.91%. Patients with first acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (n = 3030) and age- and sex-matched controls (n = 3056) were enrolled in the INTERHEART China study. The prevalence of depression in China was 21.66% in patients with AMI and 10.36% in the controls, both of which were lower than those in other 51 countries. However, depression in China was associated with a higher risk of AMI compared with other countries (China: OR = 2.27, 95% CI: 1.95–2.65; other countries: OR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.28–1.47; P < 0.001). The associated risk of AMI due to depression was higher in the North China than in South China (2.70 vs. 1.09, P < 0.001). According to the data from CKB study, the overall prevalence of major depression was 0.61% among 486,541 adults aged 30 to 79 years. Over a median follow-up of 7.2 years, higher incidence of IHD was observed in participants with major depression compared with those without (HR=1.32, 95% CI: 1.15–1.53). The risk increased significantly in urban residents (HR=1.72, 95% CI: 1.39–2.14). Major depression was an independent risk factor for heart disease. Cardiovascular risk factors Hypertension CHS 2012 to 2015 found that the weighted blood pressure (BP) of residents aged ≥18 years was 126.1/76.0 mmHg, 128.0/77.8 mmHg for men and 124.2/74.2 mmHg for women. Systolic BP increased with age, while diastolic BP first increased and then decreased with age. From 1991 to 2011, CHNS had conducted 8 cross-sectional surveys among adults aged ≥18 years in 9 provinces of China (increased to 12 provinces in 2011). It was found that the age-standardized prevalence of high-normal BP increased from 23.9% in 1991 to 33.6% in 2011 [Figure 3]. It showed an obvious upward trend before 2006, and was then kept at a consistent level from 2006 to 2011. Data from CHS showed that among Chinese residents aged ≥18 years, the overall crude prevalence of high-normal BP was 39.1% (weighted prevalence 41.3%).Figure 3: Age-standardized detection rate of high normal blood pressure in Chinese adults from 1991 to 2011 in China.The study of 101,510 employees aged 30 to 70 years in KaiLuan Group showed that high-normal BP was associated with 37% higher risk of cardiovascular events and 56% higher risk of cerebral infarction than normotensives. In 2005, 0.22 million cardiovascular deaths and 0.12 million premature cardiovascular deaths were attributable to high-normal BP in Chinese adults aged ≥40 years. Data from nationwide sampling surveys of hypertension in 1958 to 1959, 1979 to 1980, 1991, and 2002 revealed that the crude prevalence of hypertension among Chinese population aged ≥15 years was 5.1%, 7.7%, 13.6%, and 17.6%, respectively, demonstrating an increasing trend. According to CHS conducted from 2012 to 2015, the crude prevalence of hypertension in Chinese adults aged ≥18 years was 27.9% (weighted prevalence 23.2%) [Figure 4]. The weighted prevalence of hypertension was 5.2% (estimated 19.129 million) among young adults (aged 18–35 years), and the crude prevalence was 5.0%. The crude prevalence of hypertension was 44.3% in those aged 55 to 64 years, 56.0% in those 65 to 74 years, and 59.8% in those ≥75 years.Figure 4: Prevalence of hypertension of Chinese population ≥15 years old in national hypertension surveys.Based on the data from the Nationwide Survey of BP 1991, CHNS 2002, Report on Chinese Residents’ Chronic Diseases and Nutrition 2012, and CHS 2015, the awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension had been significantly elevated [Figure 5]. However, in the China Patient-Centered Evaluative Assessment of Cardiac Events (PEACE) Million Persons Project from 2014 to 2017, which enrolled 1,738,886 community-dwelling adults aged 35 to 75 years by using a convenience sampling strategy, the age-standardized and sex-standardized rates of hypertension awareness, treatment, and control were only 36.0%, 22.9% and 5.7%, respectively.Figure 5: Awareness rate, treatment rate and control rate of hypertension from 1991 to 2015.According to CHS 2012 to 2015, the crude rates of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension were higher in women than in men (55.3% vs. 47.6%, 50.1% vs. 41.2%, and 18.2% vs. 15.3%, respectively; all P < 0.05), and higher in urban residents than in rural residents (54.9% vs. 48.6%, 49.7% vs. 42.2%, and 20.4% vs. 13.6%, respectively), but they were lower in the youth than in other age groups. There is a strong causal relationship between BP level and the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. In 2005, 2.33 million cardiovascular deaths and 1.27 million premature cardiovascular deaths were attributable to increased BP in China, among which, adults with hypertension were 2.11 million and 1.15 million, respectively. In 2013, 2.5 million people died of hypertension in China, accounting for 27.5% of all-cause deaths. High systolic BP accounted for 2.54 million deaths among Chinese adults in 2017, with 95.7% of these deaths being due to CVD. Treating all hypertension would prevent about 803,000 CVD events (690,000 strokes and 113,000 MIs) and gain about 1.2 million quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) annually compared with the status quo. It was estimated that the community health or standardized management of hypertensive patients could reduce the average annual drug cost and hospitalization cost around 26 RMB and 245 RMB, respectively, and thereby save the annual direct medical expense per capita in hypertension around 210 RMB. Annual investment of 800 RMB per capita in community health management of hypertension in China can produce positive net benefits, that is, the output is greater than the input. From 2010 to 2016, the number of hypertension patients with standardized management in China doubled, from 42.159 million in 2010 to 90.23 million in 2016. The standardized management rate of hypertension patients reached 70.31%. Taking national demonstration zone of chronic diseases comprehensive prevention and control, Qiaokou District of Wuhan City, as an example, after the implementation of comprehensive prevention and control construction work in the demonstration zone, the self-reported rate and control rate of hypertension increased from 16.88% and 22.22% in 2013 to 23.71% and 51.09% in 2017, respectively, and the prevalence rate decreased from 33.71% in 2013 to 33.54% in 2017. The 2010 Chinese National Survey on Students’ Constitution and Health (CNSSCH) included more than 190,000 Han nationality participants aged 7 to 17 years. Results showed that the prevalence of hypertension was 14.5% among school-age children in China. It was higher in boys than in girls (16.1% vs. 12.9%), and elevated with increasing age in both genders (P < 0.001). According to the data from CHNS in recent 20 years, the prevalence of hypertension in Chinese school-age children increased from 10.0% in 1993 to 12.9% in 2011, with an annual increase of 0.16% on average. Obesity is the major risk factor of primary hypertension in children and adolescents. According to the data on 943,128 Han nationality participants aged 7 to 17 years in CNSSCH from 1995 to 2014, after adjusting for age, height, province, urban/rural area, the population attributable risk (PAR, %) of high hypertension because of overweight steadily increased from 6.3% in 1995 to 19.2% in 2014, the PAR% for systolic hypertension increased from 7.4% in 1995 to 26.2% in 2014. The PAR% for systolic hypertension because of overweight and obesity in both genders was approximately 2-fold greater than that for diastolic hypertension. Dyslipidemia The fourth China Chronic Disease and Risk Factor Surveillance (CCDRFS) was carried out in 2013 to 2014 based on 298 surveillance points (177 counties in rural areas and 121 districts in urban areas) from 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in the mainland of China, and recruited 163,641 adults aged ≥18 years. Chinese Adults Nutrition and Chronic Diseases Surveillance in 2015 (CANCDS 2015) was based on the national mortality surveillance system. Multistage stratified cluster random sampling was conducted in 302 surveillance sites of 8 strata according to the proportion of the urban population, overall population size, and mortality. Participants aged 18 years and above were included, and the final sample size was 179,728. In comparison with the data from Chinese Nutrition and Health Survey in 2002 (CNHS 2002, n = 49,233), the total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in CANCDS 2015 consistently increased, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels decreased. The difference between urban and rural areas narrowed [Figure 6].Figure 6: The blood lipid level of Chinese adults increased significantly. HDL-C: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; TC: Total cholesterol; TG: Triglyceride.Data from CHNS 2002, China National Survey of Chronic Kidney Disease in 2010 (CNSCKD 2010), CHNS 2011, and Report on Chinese Residents’ Chronic Diseases and Nutrition 2012 showed that the overall prevalence of dyslipidemia (defined as the presence of any type of dyslipidemia) in Chinese adults aged ≥18 years in 2002, 2010, 2011, and 2012 were 18.60%, 34.00%, 39.91% and 40.40%, respectively. According to the data from the fourth CCDRFS 2013 to 2014 and CANCDS 2015, the prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in China increased significantly by 2 to 4 times compared with that in 2010. If the borderline high level of cholesterol had been used as the cut-off value (TC ≥5.2 mmol/L, LDL-C ≥3.4 mmol/L), the prevalence of high TC and high LDL-C would be 28.5% and 26.3%, respectively, which was higher than that of low HDL-C and high TG, suggesting that the main form of dyslipidemia in China is moving towards hypercholesterolemia [Figure 7].Figure 7: Prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in Chinese residents increased significantly. HDL-C: High-density lipoprotein cholesterol; LDL-C: Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; TC: Total cholesterol; TG: Triglyceride.In 2012, a survey was conducted on 16,434 children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years from 93 primary and secondary schools in 7 provinces/autonomous regions in China. Dyslipidemia was determined by the definition of Expert Advice on Prevention and Treatment of Dyslipidemia in Children and Adolescents in 2009 (ie, TC > 5.18 mmol/L, LDL-C > 3.37 mmol/L, HDL-C > 1.03 mmol/L, and TG > 1.7 mmol/L). The prevalence of elevated TC, elevated LDL-C, low HDL-C, elevated TG, and dyslipidemia was 5.4%, 3.0%, 13.5%, 15.7%, and 28.5%, respectively. Sugary drinks intake ≥once per week, sedentary time>10 hours per day, overweight and obesity might be the risk factors of dyslipidemia among children and adolescents. At present, the awareness, treatment and control rates of dyslipidemia among Chinese adults are still at a low level [Figure 8]. In patients with high or very high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (ASCVD), the lipid-lowering therapy rates and achievement of lipid-level targets are far from satisfactory.Figure 8: Awareness, treatment and control rates of dyslipidemia among Chinese residents (data from 3 large-scale epidemiological surveys). CNSCKD: China National Survey of Chronic Kidney Disease.In the fourth CCDRFS 2013 to 2014, according to 2016 Chinese Guideline for the Management of Dyslipidemia in Adults, among Chinese adults aged ≥18 years, 1.8% (2945 participants) had very high risk for ASCVD and 9.4% (15,382 participants) had high risk for ASCVD. Only 6.8% of residents with very high risk for ASCVD and 25.5% with high risk attained their LDL-lowering goals. Among residents did not meet the LDL-C targets, only 14.5% with very high ASCVD risk and 5.5% with high ASCVD risk have received the drug therapy. In rural residents who have elevated LDL-C, the treatment rate was even lower, 4.6% for those with high ASCVD risk and 11.5% for those with very high ASCVD risk. A cohort study in China (n = 20,954, aged 35–64 years) showed that the lower the baseline LDL-C, the lower the 20-year risk of ASCVD (including acute coronary events and ischemic stroke) in participants with LDL-C levels ranging from the lowest category (<40 mg/dL) to the highest (≥160 mg/dL). A prospective study included 267,500 Chinese participants from 6 cohorts. The median follow-up duration ranged from 6 to 19 years. TC, LDL-C, and TG showed positive associations with ischemic stroke. The risks of ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke might be higher when HDL-C < 1.3 mmol/L (50 mg/dL). The risk of hemorrhagic stroke was higher when TC < 3.1 mmol/L (120 mg/dL). Diabetes mellitus A national cross-sectional survey in 2013 consisted of 170,287 participants aged 18 years or older from 31 provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in the mainland of China. Among the Chinese adult population, the estimated standardized prevalence of total diabetes was 10.9% (95% CI: 10.4%–11.5%); and that of prediabetes, 35.7% (95% CI: 34.1%–37.4%). With approximately 1.09 billion adults in total in the mainland of China, it was projected that 388 million Chinese adults might have had prediabetes in 2013. Among persons with diabetes, 36.5% (95% CI: 34.3%–38.6%) were aware of their conditions and 32.2% (95% CI: 30.1%–34.2%) were treated; 49.2% (95% CI: 46.9%–51.5%) of patients treated had adequate glycemic control. CKB, a prospective study, recruited 512,869 adults aged 30 to 79 years from 10 regions in China. Results indicated that diabetes was associated with increased mortality from IHD (RR: 2.40; 95% CI: 2.19–2.63) and stroke (RR: 1.98; 95% CI: 1.81–2.17). It was estimated that there was a loss of a median of 9 years of life for individuals with diabetes diagnosed below the age of 50 years. Da Qing Diabetes Prevention Study in China enrolled 577 adults with impaired glucose tolerance who were identified by use of 75 g oral glucose tolerance tests. The participants were randomly assigned to either a control group or one of 3 intervention groups (diet, exercise, or diet plus exercise). Interventions were started in 1986 and completed in 1992. Subsequently, participants were followed for up to 30 years to assess the effects of interventions. Compared with control, the combined intervention group had a median delay in diabetes onset of 3.96 years, an average increase in life expectancy of 1.44 years, 39% lower cumulative incidence of diabetes, 26% fewer cardiovascular disease events, and 33% fewer cardiovascular disease deaths. These data provide compelling evidence that lifestyle intervention in people with impaired glucose tolerance reduces the incidence of complications and diabetes-related mortality. Chronic kidney disease A national cross-sectional survey was conducted from 2009 to 2010 among 47,204 adults aged 18 years or older from 13 provinces in China to assess the prevalence of chronic kidney disease (CKD). The adjusted prevalence of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 60 mL/min per 1.73 m2 was 1.7% and of urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) greater than 30 mg/g was 9.4%. The overall prevalence of CKD was 10.8%. Therefore, the number of patients with CKD in China is estimated to be about 120 million. A national surveillance system for kidney disease, China Kidney Disease Network (CK-NET), reviewed data of adult inpatients (aged 18 years or older) that were submitted from tertiary hospitals to the national Hospital Quality Monitoring System (HQMS). Clinical diagnosis of CKD on the front page of the hospitalization medical record was coded according to the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 coding system. The Annual Data Report (ADR) of 2014 and 2015 revealed that patients with CKD constituted 4.5% and 4.8% of hospitalized patients, respectively. Among them, the percentage of CKD was 14.5% and 13.9% in patients with diabetes, 9.5% and 11.3% in those with hypertension, and 7.0% and 7.7% in those with CVD, respectively. In 2014, the median cost of inpatients with CKD was ¥9500, which was higher than those without CKD (¥7800). In 2015, it was ¥14,965 for inpatients with CKD and ¥11,219 for those without CKD.

For most of these countries, the estimates of asbestos health impact are limited to counts of the number of deaths from mesothelioma or estimates of the expected number of such deaths in relation to past consumption of asbestos. Wherever asbestos use is still permitted, the advocacy for an asbestos ban would benefit from more detailed estimates of the health impact of asbestos at the national or local level. This implies political endorsement, social pressure, technical expertise and access to databases above a minimum standard quality. The best estimates of asbestos risk rise from ad hoc analytical epidemiological studies. Nevertheless, these studies have hardly been carried out in countries where asbestos is still permitted. In their absence orientating raw information can be obtained from current statistics (mortality, cancer incidence, compensated asbestosis). The number of mesothelioma cases can also be tentatively estimated using a well-established relationship between asbestos consumption and mesothelioma risk. The burden of occupational exposure to asbestos for cancers of lung, larynx and ovary can be approximated computing the Attributable Fraction through current statistics allowing for an estimate of past exposures to asbestos in the workplace. In addition, for lung cancer, the proportion of cases attributable to asbestos exposure can be speculatively approximated through the use of ratios proposed in the literature between occupationally asbestos induced mesothelioma and lung cancer. When the number of asbestos related cancers is computed through such indirect approaches, the consistency between results obtained with different methods requires verification. Examples of the application of such approaches in Latin American countries will be presented.",1078-0475 2169-2181,abstract_added,openalex,1729,,,,273

The aim of this study is to estimate the proportion of lung cancer cases attributable to passive smoking among never smokers in China. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. We comprehensively searched six databases up to July 2019 for original observational studies in both English and Chinese languages. Studies that reported relative risks (RR) or odds ratios (OR) for lung cancer occurrence associated with passive smoking in Chinese never smokers were included. For each selected publication, two reviewers assessed publications in English and Chinese independently and assessed the quality of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Any disagreements encountered were settled through a consensus. The population attributable fraction (PAF) was calculated using the combined proportion of lung cancer cases exposed to passive smoking and the pooled OR yielded from meta-analysis under the assumption of homogeneity. Result: Thirty-one studies (all designed as case-control) were identified, comprising 9,614 cases and 13,093 controls. The overall proportion of lung cancer cases among never smokers attributable to passive smoking was estimated at 20.5% (95% CI: 16.0% - 24.7%), based on the proportion of lung cancer cases exposed to passive smoking (61.6%) and the pooled OR for passive smoking and lung cancer risk of 1.50 (95% CI: 1.35-1.76). The PAF was 15.5% (95%CI: 9.3%-21.0%) based on population-based studies and was 22.7% (95%CI: 16.6%-28.0%) based on hospital-based studies. The subgroup analysis (Table 1) showed that the PAF was similar in non-smoking men (20.9%) and women (21.3%). The proportion of lung cancer cases attributable to household passive smoking was much higher than workplace passive smoking (19.2% vs 10.5%). [Figure presented] Conclusion: Around 20% of lung cancer cases in never smokers, both men and women, are potentially attributable to passive smoking in China. These lung cancer cases in never smokers might be potentially prevented by eliminating exposure to passive smoking, in particular with regards to household passive smoking.

The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate the actual situation of asbestos exposure and the prevalence of asbestos-related diseases among Japanese general population. Materials and methods From 2006 to 2008, 9810 subjects (mean age, 57 years; 54% male and 50% smokers) underwent low-dose CT (LDCT) in 26 institutions in Japan. Then, 6286 (64.1%) subjects underwent subsequent screening after 2 years of interval. Clinical information such as history of asbestos exposure for all life was reviewed. Images were interpreted independently by 15 experts. Results Self-reported history of occupational exposure was present in 2805 (28.5%) subjects, whereas self-reported history of residential exposure was present in 1193 (12.2%) subjects although asbestos factory actually existed in 2870 (29.3%) subjects. Pleural plaque, pleural thickening, and pulmonary nodule were identified in 264 (2.7%), 245 (2.5%), and 1003 (10.2%) subjects on LDCT. However, self-reported history of asbestos exposure was not confirmed in 77 (29.2%) of 264 subjects with pleural plaque although asbestos factory actually existed in 65 (84.4%) of such 77 subjects. Pleural plaque on LDCT was significantly correlated with male (odds ratio OR, 2.32), age over 60 years (OR, 1.75), smoking (OR, 1.60), self-reported history of asbestos exposure (OR, 3.92), residential period in asbestos factory area (OR every 10 years, 1.13), and asbestos-related work period (7 work identified, OR every 10 years, 1.300-3–3.21). Moreover, lung cancer was identified in 29 (0.3%) subjects, resulting in significant correlation with age over 60 years (OR, 2.67) and pleural plaque (OR, 4.17). After repeated LDCT screening, among 6286 subjects consisting of 165 and 6121 subjects with and without pleural plaque on LDCT at baseline screening, respectively, 5 (3.0%) of 165 and 7 (0.1%) of 6121 subjects showed marked progression and new onset of pleural plaque, respectively. Again, lung cancer was identified in 8 (0.1%) subjects.

The Korean CARcinogen Exposure (K-CAREX) developed in 2021 is utilized to estimate the population at risk in industrial work environments in Korea (Koh et al., 2021). Our goal is to estimate preventable cancer incidence attributable to occupational carcinogens in Korea, utilizing the K-CAREX program and employing appropriate methodology. Among the exposures classified as Group 1 factors by IARC, considering the possibility of occupational exposure. Population attributable fractions (PAFs) were computed using Levin's Formula (1953), considering a latency period of 15 years between exposure and cancer in our assessment. The prevalence of exposure was calculated using K-CAREX program and census data. The relative risk (RR) for incidence was derived from a meta-analysis of literature. It was possible to calculate PAFs for 11 occupational factors linked with 8 cancer types. This estimation was chosen based on a combination of exposure and sufficient evidence of human carcinogenicity. As a result, Population attributable fractions (PAFs) for cancer incidence associated with occupational carcinogens was estimated at 1% in 2020. Lung cancer (approximately 90%) was found to be the most prevalent type of cancer attributable to occupational factors, as widely acknowledged. The prevalence of exposure to occupational carcinogens was 22%, with Diesel engine exhaust being the most significant source for both genders. Since the early 2000s, the exposure levels of asbestos, subject to usage prohibition and restriction measures, were estimated to be at a lower level compared to other countries. It is evident that these estimates reflect the characteristics of the Korean industry.

The spontaneous clonal expansion rate of pre-malignant cells was reduced at older ages under the assumptions of the TSCE model. Exposure to RDP was associated with increase in the clonal expansion rate during exposure but not afterwards. The increase was stronger for lower exposure rates. A radiation-induced bystander effect could be a possible explanation for such an exposure response. Results on excess risks were compared to a linear dose-response parametric excess risk model with attained age, time since exposure and dose rate as effect modifiers.

Cancer was generally considered incurable until the late 19th century. Only with a refined understanding of the nature of cancer and strategies for cancer treatment could a systematic approach to cancer prevention emerge. The 20th century saw the elucidation of clues to cancer causation from observed associations with population exposures to tobacco, diet, environmental chemicals, and other exogenous factors. With repeated confirmation of such associations, researchers entertained for the first time the possibility that cancer, like many of the infectious diseases of the time, might be prevented. By the mid-20th century, with antibiotics successfully addressing the majority of infectious diseases and high blood pressure treatment beginning to affect the prevalence of heart disease in a favorable direction, the focus of much of epidemiology shifted to cancer. The early emphasis was on exploring, in greater depth, the environmental, dietary, hormonal, and other exogenous exposures for their potential associations with increased cancer risk. The first major breakthrough in identifying a modifiable cancer risk factor was the documentation of an association between tobacco smoking and lung cancer. During the past four decades, epidemiologic studies have generated population data identifying risk factors for cancers at almost every body site, with many cancers having multiple risk factors. The development of technologies to identify biological molecules has facilitated the incorporation of these molecular manifestations of biological variation into epidemiologic studies, as markers of exposure as well as putative surrogate markers of cancer outcome. This technological trend has, during the past two decades, culminated in emphasis on the identification of genetic variants and their products as correlates of cancer risk, in turn, creating opportunities to incorporate the discipline of molecular/genetic epidemiology into the study of cancer prevention. Epidemiology will undoubtedly continue contributing to cancer prevention by using traditional epidemiologic study designs to address broad candidate areas of interest, with molecular/genetic epidemiology investigations honing in on promising areas to identify specific factors that can be modified with the goal of reducing risk. © 2009 American Association for Cancer Research.",0008-5472 and 1538-7445,-1,embase,1141,,,,280

Incidence, age-standardised incidence rate (ASIR), deaths, age-standardised mortality rate (ASMR), disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), age-standardised rate of DALYs (ASDR), and the burden due to risk factors associated with TBL cancer were analysed from 1990 to 2021. Trends in ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR of TBL cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-2021) were also determined. All statistical analyses were performed using Join-point software (version 4.9.1.0). Between 1990 and 2021, the global incidence, deaths, and DALYs of TBL cancer to varying degrees. However, the ASIR (Average Annual Percent Change [AAPC], -0.3 [-0.4 to -0.2]), ASMR (AAPC, -0.5 [-0.7 to -0.4]), and ASDR (AAPC, -0.9 [-1.0 to -0.7]) all showed a decreasing trend. However, the ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR of TBL cancer in males all showed a decreasing trend from 1990 to 2021. In contrast, the ASIR and ASMR of TBL cancer in females showed an increasing trend, while the ASDR showed a relatively stable trend. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the trends for ASIR, ASMR, and ASDR remained stable across both sexes combined, females, males, five socio-demographic index (SDI) quintiles, and the 21 GBD regions. In 2021, smoking was a major risk factor for TBL cancer DALYs, but the attributable ASDR for smoking decreased from 1990 to 2021 in both sexes combined, as well as individually for males and females. Conversely, the attributable ASDR for secondhand smoke, high fasting plasma glucose and occupational exposure factors increased primarily among females. Furthermore, the attributable ASDR for ambient particulate matter pollution, household air pollution from solid fuels, and low-fruit diets increased primarily in regions with lower SDI quintiles from 1990 to 2021.

In women, aRR for smoking was 1.37 (95%-IC: 1.26-1.48), but additional adjustment had limited effect on occupation (1% on average). The most at-risk female occupations were electrical engineering, electronics, watchmaking, vehicle construction and toolmaking (aRR: 2.53, 95%-IC: 1.88-3.40), computer (aRR: 2.47, 95%-IC: 1.75- 3.48) and transport and traffic (aRR: 2.25, 95%-IC: 1.77-2.86). The results suggest the presence of occupational exposures to lung carcinogens in addition to smoking and other non-occupational exposures. This finding justifies further studies and risk-reduction interventions in at-risk occupations.",2474-7882,-1,embase,1031,,,,283

Through the local Cancer Registry, pathology records of 938 men who died of primary lung cancer (ICD 162) in a five-year period were examined. Residential, smoking and occupational histories were obtained from interviews of next of kin of 756 cases and 756 age-matched male controls (+/- 2 years). Occupational exposures to lung carcinogens were assessed according to a job-title based approach, identifying industries/occupations with well-recognized lung carcinogen exposures (list A) and industries/occupations with suspected lung carcinogen exposures (list B). Exposure to asbestos was classified as absent, possible or definite. After adjustment for cigarette smoking (four levels) and residence (three levels), a significant association was found between lung cancer and occupations in list A (RR = 2.28, 95% CI = 1.70-3.07) and in list B (RR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.04-1.71). A significant excess risk was found for workers with definite exposure to asbestos when compared to those with no exposure to lung carcinogens (RR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.43-2.76). A very high relative risk was observed among heavy smokers with definite exposure to asbestos (RR = 42.8). A stratified analysis showed that the combined effect of asbestos and smoking was compatible with that expected under a multiplicative model. The overall attributable risk in the population (ARp) for cigarette smoking was found to be 87.6%. The ARp fraction for occupations with well-established exposures to lung carcinogens (list A) was 16.2%. The ARp fraction increased to 25.5% (85% CI = 1.4-34.6) when occupations with suspected exposure to lung carcinogens (list B) were included.

In consequence, asbestos-containing floor tiles and mastic have been identified by regulatory agencies as hazardous materials. The reason for this categorisation is the suggested potential for these materials to cause asbestos-related diseases and as a result special handling has been prescribed. However, studies have reported that little airborne asbestos exposure occurs during abatement of these materials. Evaluation of exposure levels in comparison with levels with the potential of disease causation suggests that there is little likelihood of workers handling or removing these materials developing an asbestos-related disease. When the maximum exposure level of 0.02f·ml-1 (0.8f·ml-1 year) found during studies is considered over a 40-year period and evaluated with epidemiological data, the risk of mesothelioma, asbestosis and lung cancer may be estimated to that reported for background levels.

In this paper, the general methods and the models for retrospective estimation of the radiation exposure received by these workers, and for the determination of the attributable cancer risk are briefly outlined. With respect to lung cancer among uranium miners, inhalation of the shortlived radon progenies proves to be by far the most important component of exposure. For the determination of the attributable risk of extrapulmonary cancers, however, the inhalation of natural uranium contained in ore dust particles has, in addition, to be taken into account.

These risk estimates were based on age-specific, gender-specific and organ-specific cancer risks derived primarily from the Japanese A-bomb survivors [2,3]. We estimated that these risk estimates were probably good to within a factor of three, in both directions.Now, Pearce et al [4] have published in The Lancet the first epidemiological study to show an excess incidence of leukaemia and brain cancer in children and adolescents who had received CT scans. The authors studied a cohort of 178 604 children who underwent a CT scan between 1985 and 2002 in various hospitals in the UK, estimated organ doses involved, and then identified subsequent malignancies via linkage to the National Health Service Central Registry. The average follow-up time was a little under 10 years. This study was possible in the UK because of the available electronic records, but would be incredibly difficult to repeat in many other countries, including the USA. It is a large, well-conducted, record-based cohort study, and so deserves attention.We know from the ongoing study of the Japanese A-bomb survivors that to obtain lifetime risk estimates the irradiated population needs to be studied for at least 50–60 years! To focus on leukaemia (and to an extent brain cancer) in children is effectively a shortcut because these malignancies have a short latent period in children. For example, the great majority of radiation-induced leukaemias appear within 10 years of exposure.Pearce et al [4] reported that the risk of leukaemia was positively associated with estimated doses delivered by CT scans to the red bone marrow, as was the risk of brain cancers associated with estimated doses delivered by CT scans to the brain. Quantitatively, having two to three head scans triples the estimated risk of brain cancer, while five to ten head scans triples the estimated risk of leukaemia. Of course, these very small radiation risks must be viewed in the context of the extraordinary clinical usefulness of CT in a great variety of clinical settings.Human epidemiology trumps all calculations and estimates, of course. So how do these new data impact our review [1] of what was known in 2008?The new data confirm that the cancer risk associated with the radiation from a CT scan is very small, but not zero. It can be detected in a cohort of a few hundred thousand children. The individual risk is very small and is far outweighed by the benefit of the diagnosis, provided the scan is clinically justified. The new study is important because it provides human epidemiological data supporting the notion that doses as low as those involved in CT scans can induce a detectable cancer incidence in humans.Our estimated lifetime risk of leukaemia from one paediatric head CT scan, based on the A-bomb data, was about 1 in 10 000 [1,2]. The estimate of Pearce et al [4] based on the epidemiological data was also about 1 in 10 000. Good agreement!Our estimate of the lifetime risk of brain cancer from a paediatric head CT scan was about 1 in 2000 [1,2]. The risk estimate of Pearce et al [4] was 1 in 10 000, to the end of follow-up. A big difference here, but there is a simple explanation: the average length of follow-up in the Pearce et al paper is only about 8–10 years. The study of children epilated with X-rays for the treatment of tinea capitis [5] shows that only about 10% of the final lifetime risk of brain cancer shows up in the first decade after irradiation. If this factor of 10 is corrected for, the lifetime brain tumour risk estimate would be about 1 in 1000, agreeing reasonably well with the A-bomb-derived estimate of 1 in 2000. The reason for the difference may be that some of the CT scans were performed on children with early symptoms of a brain tumour that was only diagnosed much later. The authors tried to avoid this problem as far as possible by excluding brain tumours occurring within 5 years of the scan.In order to get a result in a relatively short time, Pearce et al [4] focused on leukaemia and brain cancer in irradiated children. It is therefore quite a limited study. A knowledge of the spectrum of all the other solid cancers after paediatric CT, and all malignancies after adult CT, must await further studies, and these are likely to take many years and involve significant difficulties. There are many other groups studying (or planning to study) national cohorts of CT patients. Some will have a longer follow-up and larger numbers, so they may well contribute further information about cancer induction at low radiation doses. However, they all suffer from the same limitation; namely, that these efforts focus on paediatric CT. They will not provide data relevant to the vast majority of CT scans, given that at least 90% of all CT scans are in adults.Meanwhile, for most CT scans, we have estimates based only on organ doses and the Japanese A-bomb data. These estimates have proved to be in reasonable agreement with the epidemiological data in the few cases where it is possible to check them (i.e. for leukaemia and brain cancer from a head CT scan). Based on the Japanese A-bomb data, the risk estimates for abdominal CT scans are about 10 times larger than for head CT scans because of all of the radiogenic organs located in the trunk of the body, and, as pointed out above, there are no epidemiological data in sight to check these numbers. Estimates are all we will have for the foreseeable future, but even if they are only approximate, they are important at a time of increasing concern about the major increase in the collective dose from medical radiation over the past two decades, with much of it due to the burgeoning use of CT. The current estimate is almost 5 million CT scans per year in the UK, and about 85 million per year in the United States. The Pearce et al study [4] is an important piece of additional evidence to show that low doses of radiation do carry some (admittedly small) risk, which must be taken into account.",0007-1285 1748-880X,-1,openalex,1600,,,,289

(1) The ethnic background of Australians is predominantly Caucasian (83.6%) with 5.2% Chinese ancestry and 2.8% Indigenous Australian in 2016 census data.(1) It has one of the lowest current smoking rates in the world with only 14% of people >18 years being current smokers in 2017-2018.(2) Despite this, lung cancer remains the greatest cause of cancer death for women and men and is the fourth leading cause of all deaths in Australia. (2,3) Lung cancer cases continue to increase due to a variety of reasons including our growing and ageing population and the lag time between the tobacco epidemic and lung cancer occurrence.(4) Lung cancer rates in Indigenous Australians are approximately double compared to non-Indigenous Australians.(4) Overall, the majority of lung cancer in Australia is attributable to tobacco exposure but 20% of lung cancer occurs in never smokers.(4) There are known gender differences with ∼90% of lung cancer in men attributable to tobacco exposure but only ∼75% in women. (4) Other occupational exposures play an important role in lung cancer in Australia, with asbestos being one of the most important toxins contributing to lung cancer incidence. (1) A large longitudinal screening program in asbestos exposed individuals (>1700 participants) is ongoing in Western Australia, the Asbestos Review Project. The project has been utilising low dose chest computed tomography (CT) screening since 2012. Lung cancer rates in this cohort are similar to a high-risk smoking cohort despite lower tobacco exposures. The use of current screening enrolment criteria (USPSTF/NCCN) would have resulted in most lung cancer cases being missed. (5) Population based screening programs in Australia have been implemented for cervical, breast and bowel cancers but currently there is no national screening program for lung cancer. A proposed screening program must meet the Australian Screening Framework established in 2008 and be endorsed by the Standing Committee on Screening and the Australian Health Minister’s Advisory Council. (6) In their last published statement in 2015, implementation of a national program has not been supported.(7) The definition of the appropriate population to screen and the likely uptake of screening requires further evaluation in the Australian population. The reduction in mortality from lung cancer screening only occurs in those at high risk so the delineation of this cohort is crucial for minimisation of harm and a cost-effective program.(8) International work evaluating various risk prediction models to define the population that would most benefit from lung cancer screening have been published. (8,9) The performance of one of the most well validated models, the PLCOM2012, has been retrospectively evaluated in the Australian population in a subset of the 45 and Up study.(10) In this large longitudinal cohort, 95 882 ever smokers, >45 years were included in the analysis. The predictive power of the PLCOM2012 risk model was assessed compared to other potential lung cancer screening enrolment criteria (NLST, USPSTF). This study showed that the risk model, although derived from a North American population, performed equally as well in the Australian population. It would reduce the proportion of ever smokers >55 years, potentially eligible for screening to ∼29%. However, only 2% of the cohort were of Asian ancestry and 1.6% Indigenous Australian. The PLCO risk prediction model has been utilised prospectively in the PanCanadian study and further prospective validation is ongoing in Australia, Canada and Hong Kong in the International LungScreen Trial (ILST). The further refinement of a risk prediction model incorporating occupational/environmental carcinogen exposures such as asbestos and ethnicity is needed to further improve risk assessment for lung cancer screening.

Current models have focused primarily on white heavy smokers; therefore, the construction of risk models based on data from lung cancer studies involving minority participants is clearly warranted. The purpose of this analysis was to identify lung cancer risk factors for African Americans and Mexican Americans and to construct risk models for these two groups, respectively. Methods: We constructed risk models for African Americans and Mexican Americans, separately, and calculated absolute 5-year risks of lung cancer on the basis of data from 703 patients with lung cancer (491 African Americans and 212 Mexican Americans) and 825 controls. Data included smoking history, environmental and occupational exposures, medical history and family history of cancer. Results: The risk models included participants’ age at smoking cessation (former smokers), pack-years smoked (current smokers), current body mass index, and whether participants had prior chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or hay fever or had been exposed to asbestos (African Americans), wood dust (African Americans), or pesticides (Mexican Americans). The discriminatory powers for our ethnic-specific lung models were 0.79 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77-0.82) for African Americans and 0.74 (95% CI = 0.69-0.79) for Mexican Americans; these discriminatory powers were higher than those obtained using a lung cancer risk model based white subjects to predict lung cancer among our Mexican American and African American smokers. Conclusions: Our lung cancer risk models showed that minority populations may share lung cancer exposures with whites but also exhibit differing levels of risks and unique risks specifically related to occupational exposures. Validation of these risk models in independent populations is warranted.",,abstract_added,openalex,1715,,,,293

The purpose of this study was to estimate the role of past asbestos exposure as a cause of radiographic small lung opacities and pleural abnormalities in the Finnish adult population. Methods. The study was conducted in 1978-1981 and was based on a population sample (N = 8000) representative of the Finnish population aged 30 years or over. Full-size chest radiographs and a complete job title history were available for 3811 women and 3274 men. The radiographs were classified according to the 1980 classification of radiographs of pneumoconioses published by the International Labour Office and the work histories according to the probability of occupational asbestos exposure. Age- and smoking-adjusted relative risks of radiographic parenchymal and pleural abnormalities were calculated with the analysis of covariance according to the probability of asbestos exposure. Results. About 13% of the men and 0.8% of the women were classified as probably exposed to asbestos. There was more than 90% agreement in the repeated work history evaluations. The risk of small lung opacities was significantly increased among the probably exposed men [risk ratio (RR) 1.7 for ILO profusion category 1/1 or more and RR 1.6 for profusion category 1/0]. The risk of pleural plaques was increased both among the men (RR 3.0) and the women (RR 4.8) with probable exposure. The risk of thickened horizontal interlobar fissure was also increased among the probably exposed men (RR 1.7). Among the men, the etiologic fraction attributable to occupational asbestos exposure was about 30% for small lung opacities, about 40% for pleural plaques, and about 20% for thickened horizontal fissure. Among the women the etiologic fractions for asbestos were similar for pleural abnormalities, but much lower for parenchymal ones. Conclusions. Occupational asbestos exposure has been common among Finnish men, and it plays a significant role in the etiology of both pleural and parenchymal abnormalities also at the level of the general population.",0355-3140,-1,embase,1232,,,,294

Different criteria have been used in including occupational exposures from published studies: (i) exposure to lung carcinogens according to a job-exposure matrix approach; (ii) occupations in which an increased risk of lung cancer has been established; (iii) occupations in which an increased risk of lung cancer has been suggested; and (iv) occupations associated with a statistically significant increase of lung cancer. Only studies in which the confounding effect of smoking was controlled for have been included. We found a wide variability of ARp estimates, mainly due to the different geographical locations of the studies, while they seem to be only moderately affected by the different criteria of inclusion of the relevant occupational exposures. Studies using job-exposure matrices gave ARps ranging from 0.6% to 35%. When a list of recognized carcinogenic exposures was used for the selection of the relevant occupations, the estimates varied between 2.4% and 40%. From the studies reviewed it also appears that tobacco smoking has a very limited confounding effect.

Honda et al. published a study of mortality among New York talc workers and concluded that it was unlikely that the two deaths from mesothelioma were caused by talc ore dust. However, fibers of tremolite and anthophyllite have been found in the lungs of talc workers and Hull concluded that ""New York talc exposure is associated with mesothelioma, and deserves further public health attention."" Methods: Data concerning additional cases of mesothelioma in the cohort have been posted by NIOSH. I used information from the NIOSH website and the Honda report to analyze the incidence of mesothelioma during the years 1990-2007. Results: There were at least five new cases of mesothelioma in the cohort and mesothelioma incidence rates were at least five (1.6-11.7) times the rate in the general population (P<0.01). Conclusions: I conclude that: (1) mesothelioma has been diagnosed among members of the cohort at a rate in excess of that in the general population; (2) fibers of tremolite and anthophyllite have been detected in dust and the lungs of talc workers; and (3) these fibers are known causes of mesothelioma.

Slopes of dose-response relations for lung cancer show a tendency to decrease with increasing dose. Our best estimate of curvilinearity is given by raising dose to the power 0.92 +/- 0.07, but the improvement in fit beyond simple linearity is not significant. On the other hand, the addition of a cell-killing term significantly improves the fit of the linear model. In any event, linear extrapolation is unlikely to underestimate the excess risk at low doses by more than a factor of 1.5. However, these inferences about curvilinearity are highly subject to error from the choice of reference populations, dosimetry, and latency. Under the linear-cell-killing model, our best estimate of excess relative risk is 2.28 +/- 0.35 per 100 working level month (WLM) (a doubling dose of 44 WLM). Attributable risks in these five studies range from 3.4-17.8 per 10(6) person-yr WLM-1. Risks from Rn progeny appear to interact with age and smoking in a form intermediate between additive and multiplicative. The ""relative risk"" model is therefore preferable for projecting lifetime risks, but life-table projections are described for a wide variety of assumptions. Our best estimate of the effect of a 50-yr occupational exposure to 4 WLM yr-1 is 130 excess lung cancer deaths per 1000 persons (0.65 per 1000 person-WLM), with a range from 60-250 per 1000.

This has created tremendous burden on natural resources. Overcrowding and inadequate housing, unplanned location of the industries in the urban and sub urban areas and traffic congestion, have lead to deterioration of environment with consequent adverse effects on health of mankind. Lack of gainful employment in villages and ecological stress is leading to an ever-increasing movement of the poor families to towns. Mega cities are emerging and urban slums are expanding. The relationship between urbanization and industrialization is complex as it operates in both the directions and is mediated by the socio political factors, environment and disease exposure. One of the major impacts of this transformation is “Westernization” leading to a change in the lifestyle pattern. At the start of the new millennium, the pace and complexity of the life seems to be increasing exponentially. While the penetration and influence of modern communications, technology and economic systems related to what is termed as “globalization” have been a dominant theme since the late twentieth century, there seems to have a confluence of changes in these factors that have led to a major global concern about the rapid globalization of the world economy and its impact on various sub populations. As a result, the urban elites in the developing world are experiencing higher rate of non-communicable diseases, that demand medical therapy of the kind, found in affluent societies i.e. high technology & hospital based medical care, thus escalating the cost of health care. In 1997, Murray and Lopez has published the results of Global Burden of Disease Study1 and found that in the last two or three decades, there has been profound shift in the major cause of mortality worldwide with non communicable chronic diseases such as cancer, Cardio Vascular Disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes mellitus accounting for more than two-third of the deaths. The leading causes of death and disability and the risk factors that cause them their global ranking, and their distribution by broad region, is shown in Figure I Further, in both developing and developed countries alcohol, tobacoo, and dietary factors were found to be the main causes of disease burden. Table I summarizes the contribution of selected risk factors for the leading diseases causing deaths. The increasing prevalence of COPD, thus is, not an exception to be associated with the development of “Western lifestyle”. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema2–5, is a progressive disease characterized by airflow limitation/obstruction that is either not reversible at all or only partially reversible. The airflow obstruction in COPD is associated with abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs to chronic inhalational exposure from smokes, dusts and gases. COPD includes chronic obstructive bronchiolitis with fibrosis and obstruction of small airways and emphysema with enlargement of air spaces and destruction of lung parenchyma, loss of lung elasticity and closure of small airways.. Most patients with COPD have all the three pathological mechanisms (chronic obstructive bronchiolitis, emphysema and mucus plugging) as all are induced by smoking but may differ in proportion of emphysema and obstructive bronchiolitis6.FIG I: Global Burden of Disease attributable to 20 leading selected risk factorsSource: World Health Report 2002Table 1: Individual and joint contribution of selected risk factors to leading cause of deathsAgeing of population is not the only cause of the increased prevalence of COPD observed in the industrialized countries but other risk factors must be taken into account. The tobacco smoking epidemic, which hit the developed countries, especially among young people and subsequently among women, and spreading in other countries, is the most important cause. Table II summarizes the risk factors involved in the causation of COPD, either singly or interacting among themselves.Table 2: Trend in % of COPD mortality from smoking worldwide during the period 1985-1995 (age 5-69 years)Cigarette smoking is by far the commonest cause of COPD but there are other modifiable risk factors including air pollution (particularly indoor air pollution from burning fuels) and occupational exposures. Table III gives an account for preventable risk factors due to change in the lifestyle associated with the development of COPD.Table 3: Risk factors associated with the development of COPDA] SMOKING Smoking is the detrimental risk factor in the development and progression of COPD. Trends in worldwide mortality of COPD from smoking during the period 1985-1995 are shown in the Table IV Emphysema, a major component of COPD, is thought to be due to an excess of proteases, causing destruction of elastin and collagen matrix supporting the lung structure. Tobacco smoking causes an influx of neutrophils into the lungs and a subsequent release of elastase and proteases. Oxidants inhaled from tobacco smoke and released from the activated inflammatory cells play a role in the development of emphysema by impairing endogeneous antiproteases.Table 4: Preventable risk factors associated with the development of COPDA large number of people, men and women, smoke for pleasure, relaxation, relief of tension or for a sense of security. Among the many social changes recorded in the industrialized world, smoking behavior is explained as social conditioning and social desirability. By smoking, a smoker subconsciously projects the image of prosperity, power or potency. While smoking rates are declining among men in some countries, it is rising among women worldwide. There were large increases in smoking in developing countries, especially among males, over the last part of the 20th century78. This contrasts with the steady but slow decrease, mostly among men, in many industrialized countries. Smoking rates remain relatively high in most former socialist economies. While prevalence of tobacco use has declined in some high-income countries, it is increasing in some low and middle income countries, especially among young people and women. By the year 2025, the number of women smoker is expected to triple. Women born in United States have the highest level of smoking (32%) compared to South European (20%) and Asian born women (21%) Growing participation of women in active professional life has increased the number of smokers. Industry marketing and advertising strategies are particularly targeted to women and young girls. “Feminine” brands emphasizing low tar, length and slimness have successfully played on traditional fear of weight gain. This has been attributed to the fact that in Scotland rate of COPD have almost doubled amongst women in past 10 years9. The growing trends of tobacco consumption amongst children is due to increasing marketism and consumerism along with Westernisation. Unlike adults, children do not buy cheapest cigarettes, they buy the trendiest, most advertised brands. Tobacoo advertising is intended to increase the consumption as well as brand and has a powerful effect on young people10. Cigarette: Cigarette smokers, have higher prevalence of lung function abnormalities and respiratory symptoms, a greater annual rate of decline in FEV1 and higher death rate from COPD as compared to non smokers. The decline in FEV1 in smokers was proved in a longitudinal study in UK11. Pipe and cigar smokers have higher COPD mortality and morbidity rates than non smokers, although it was lower than that of cigarette smokers12. Bidi: In India alone, bidi consumption is 900 billions sticks are smoked per year. The amount of tobacco used in bidis is twice to that used in bidi13. Bidi smoking is thus more likely to cause clinical and functional impairment of lungs as compared to cigarette smoking14. II ENVIRONMENTAL TOBACCOO SMOKE (ETS) Environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) constitutes a common problem in many countries. Passively inhaled tobacco smoke contains several known and probable human carcinogens, as well as irritants and toxic substances15. Passive smoking to cigarette smoke may also contribute to respiratory symptoms and COPD by increasing the lungs total burden of inhaled particulars and gases16–18. The Canadian Human Time-Activity Pattern Survey has shown that exposure to ETS is common among children, particularly in their homes19. Recent studies have shown significant effects from ETS on the occurrence of chronic respiratory symptoms in adults, but only in a limited number of studies has exposure to ETS actually been associated with COPD in adults and with a small impairment of lung function. Maternal smoking Results from animal studies showed that fetal lung development was adversely influenced by maternal smoking This suggested that prenatal exposure to substances inhaled by the smoking mother may be a risk factor for COPD20. Maternal smoking is related to lung function deficits in neonates21. Postnatal exposure to tobacco smoke conveys increased risks of lower respiratory infections and reduced lung function2223. Smoking during pregnancy affects the lung growth and development in uterus and possibly the priming of immune function2425. Infants of smoking parents have more respiratory illness than infants of non smoking parents26. B] WORK EXPOSURE OR OCCUPATIONAL DUST For many years, researchers have known that chronic exposure to fumes, chemical substances, and dusts in the work place are one of the main risk factors for the development of COPD. The most important are grain, isocyanates, cadmium, coal and other mineral dusts, heavy metals, adhesives and welding fumes. The table IV shows the list of agents associated with COPD. Rapid population growth and urbanization has led to lack of services such as supply of food, water and housing. Lack of employment in villages and the ecological stress has led leading to an ever-increasing movement of poor families to town. Industrialization occurs when a nation's economic system decreases its reliance on hand made goods and increases its reliance upon producing goods by machine. With this, occupational health hazards are also increasing.Table 5: Occupational risk factors for COPDWhen the exposures are sufficiently intense or prolonged, occupational dust and chemicals (vapors, irritants and fumes) can cause COPD independently of cigarette smoking. It increases the risk of the disease in presence of concurrent cigarette smoking27. There is now growing that airway obstruction (COPD) is caused by other exposures rather than tobacco smoke alone, and that occupational exposures, particularly dusts, are important amongst such causes. The widespread habit of tobacco smoking, in industrial population also has delayed the recognition of the other factors contributing the disease. Farmers, grain workers, construction or cement exposed workers; foundry workers, wood workers and workers exposed to excess heat including furnace workers have been identified as the increased risk groups. Longitudinal studies of the effects of occupational exposures have been performed in coal miners28 hard-rock miners29 tunnel workers30 concrete-manufacturing workers31 and in a subject of nonmining industrial workers in Paris32. Grain dust exposure also has been established as a risk factor in COPD, both in smokers and nonsmokers33. Development of disease is influenced by the amount of exposure and the toxicity of the dust, and the disease is characterized by long latency periods; therefore, even in countries in which exposures have been recognized and controlled, the disease rates are only gradually declining34. Rate trends in developing countries are mostly unknown but the magnitude of the problem is substantial35. C] AIR POLLUTION a) OUTDOOR POLLUTION Air pollution is another important risk factors for COPD. Chronic exposure to elevated air pollution seems to correlate with chronic bronchitis and lung function impairment. The populations of the rapidly expanding mega cities of Asia, Africa and Latin America are increasingly exposed to levels of ambient air pollution that rival and often exceed those experienced in industrialized countries in the first half of the 20th century36. The factors accounting for the deteriorating urban air quality are growing industrialization and increasing vehicular traffic. Industrial emissions, automobile exhaust and the burning of fossil fuels leads to respiratory damage, heart disease and lung diseases. Conventional outdoor pollutants includes fossil fuel smoke, sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxides and ozone. Air pollution has worsened due to traffic congestion, poor housing, poor sanitation, and drainage and garbage accumulation. A study reported related photochemical oxidants and multiple primary air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide particles and hydrocarbons to chronic respiratory symptoms and pulmonary function abnormalities in both smokers and nonsmokers37. As shown in Table VI the mortality impacts of air pollution using vital statistics for 1991, deaths would increase by 1,385 in Delhi if TSP were to increase by 100 micrograms, whereas the Schwartz and Dockery coefficient for total nontrauma deaths predicts an increase of 3,524 deaths.Table 6: Selected Occupational Agents Associated With COPDTable 7: Mortality Impacts of Air Pollutionb) INDOOR POLLUTION Household energy and indoor air pollution pose a substantial vulnerability to the health of rural women and children. The highest concentration of indoor air pollutants emerges from burning of biofuels such as wood, agriculture crops and dung cake, which are extensively used by rural households in India. It has been estimated that approximately half the global population and up to 90 percent of rural households in developing countries still rely on biomass fuels38 and about 75 per cent of Indian households use biofuels for cooking purposes. Typically cooked indoors in open fires or poorly functioning stoves, which leads to levels of air pollution that are among the highest ever measured. Therefore indoor air pollution with biofuels is an issue that requires to be addressed through gender, energy, environment and health policy. Some of highest concentrations of pollutants come about due to the use of biofuels for cooking in rural indoor environment39. In developed countries transformation has without exception been come with by a shift from biofuel to petroleum products (kerosene, LPG) and electricity. In developing countries even where cleaner more sophisticated fuels are available, households often continue to use biomass40. Although the portion of global energy derived from biofuel has fallen substantially which is evidence that biofuel use is increasing among the poor. Poverty is one of the main hurdles to the adoption of cleaner fuels and slow pace of development in many countries implies that biofuels will continue to be used by the poor for many years. In addition to passive smoking, which is well known for its harmful action on respiratory health, a number of compounds and mixtures have been identified as relevant air pollutants indoors41. These may be derived from heating, combustion, photochemical reactions, furniture, building materials, biological organisms and fibers The smoke from combustion of solid such as wood, dried dung and crop residue used for cooking and heating is the significant cause of indoor air pollution. Over-crowding and inadequate housing conditions contribute to indoor air pollution and related diseases. Respiratory symptoms have been related to the use of several domestic fuels, such as kerosene and other fuels in India. It is accountable for large number of COPD in the rural inhabitants in general and women in particular42–45. Main health effects from indoor pollution are respiratory symptoms, lung function reduction and decline, bronchial hyper-responsiveness and respiratory infections, some of which are also characteristics of COPD. D] DIET There is usually a sequence in the emergence of chronic disease as the diet in developing countries becomes westernized. The “Westernized” diet of developed countries is characterized by excess of fat and free sugars and deficiency of complex carbohydrate foods-the main source of dietary fibers. A major factor that has greatly impacted the dietary pattern is urbanization in developing countries as a household can no longer depend on home grown produce any more. While rural communities depend on staple crops of cereals, tubers, vegetables and fruits, urbanization leads to increased consumption animal fat and sugar. This new diet pattern is perceived as a status symbol and readily accepted by other affluent communities. Within the urban setting, the food industry exerts substantial influence by promoting consumption of soft drinks, meat products, confectionary, snack foods, and other convenience foods rich in free sugars and fats. Bruney et al in a study showed that changes in dietary habits, such as increasing salt intake, decreasing intake of fruits and vegetables, and changing fatty acid consumption of the diet, were suggested to contribute to the rise in COPD mortality and morbidity. The fact that not all patients with COPD are smokers but only 20 % of the smokers develop COPD46 has led to the alternative theories as to why some people appear to be more vulnerable to effects of cigarette smoke. Various studies have described the presence of nutritional abnormalities in patients with COPD. The most obvious clinical expression of these nutritional abnormalities is unexplained weight loss. Malnutrition contributes to respiratory muscle weakness resulting in increased frequency of hospitalization, Cor pulmonale and increased mortality. Nutrition depletion, as indicated by weight loss and loss of lean body mass, a common complication of advanced COPD (particularly, but not limited to, the emphysematous type). Low body weight or recent weight loss and in particular depleted lean body mass in patients with COPD have been shown to be independent predictors of mortality, poor outcomes after acute excaberations, hospital admission rates, and need for mechanical ventilation. The factors thought to contribute to nutrition depletion in these patients include elevated resting and activity-related energy expenditure, reduced dietary intake relative to energy expenditure, accelerated negative nitrogen balance, particularly during acute exacerbations of COPD, medication effects, and perhaps most importantly an elevated systemic inflammatory response. E] ALCOHOL Global alcohol consumption has increased in recent decades, with most or all of this increase occurring in developing countries. Both average volume of alcohol consumption and patterns of drinking vary dramatically between sub regions. Average volume of drinking is highest in Europe and North America, and lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean. Patterns are most detrimental in Europe. Patterns are least detrimental in Western Europe (EURA) and the more economically established parts of the Western Pacific region (World Health Report 2002) Reports on the association between alcohol consumption and the prevalence of COPD vary. Heavy alcohol consumption was associated with respiratory symptoms and reduced lung function in a study by Lebowitz47 even when controlled for smoking. Smoking, however, was judged to be a far more important risk factor. The effect of passive smoking would have to be also considered in any heavy drinker, smoker or not, who consumed his or her favorite beverage in heavily tobacco-polluted bars or restaurants. F] SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS Socioeconomic status may be assessed by using a series of indicators, which include income, education, type of work, house conditions, crowding index (family size with respect to house size). A low socioeconomic level is a risk factor for the development of emphysema and chronic bronchitis48. Strachan49 analyzing the 1979-1983 mortality rates in Great Britain, showed that, for both bronchitis-emphysema-asthma and trachea-bronchuslung cancer, the standardized mortality ratio increased with a decreasing socioeconomic status. An association between the prevalence of chronic bronchitis and a low socioeconomic status, even after adjusting for smoking and other risk factors was detected in Brazil in 1994. In Norway, Bakke et al.50 found adjusted odds ratios of spirometric airflow limitation of 5.2 and 1.8 for subjects who had completed only primary and secondary education, respectively, compared to university graduates. The socioeconomic status in early life might be a relevant risk factor for COPD as shown by a longitudinal analysis of the British Medical Research Council's national survey of health and development of the 1946 birth cohort51. At the age of 36 years, in both sexes, the presence of respiratory symptoms and the level of peak expiratory flow were independently associated with current indices of poor social circumstances and with poor environment at the age of 2 years. CONCLUSION COPD and related conditions result in a huge burden in terms of health resource utilization as well as in overall costs worldwide. The striking increase in COPD prevalence globally cannot be primarily due to genetic factors, since it is occurring too rapidly, and therefore it must be occurring due to changes in environmental exposures. It seems that as a result of “Westernization package” changes in the lifestyle and environmental condition, we are seeing an increased susceptibility to the development of COPD. There are number of elements in this “package” including increased consumption of tobacco smoking amongst females and children, changing dietary pattern and increasing burden of industries and population leading to increased air pollution. All of these are associated with the increased risk of the disease, but none of which alone cannot explain the increase in prevalence. Thus it is important that we consider the “forest” of these changes that occur with westernization while doing studies on specific “trees”.",0970-2113 0974-598X,-1,openalex,1634,,,,300

Estimates were calculated using Swedish register data on occupation in 1970, lung cancer incidence in 1971-1989, smoking frequencies in 1963, and the formula I = RI0F + I0(1-F), where I is the overall incidence, R is the relative risk associated with a factor (here smoking), F is the fraction of persons at risk (smokers), and I0 is the incidence among those not at risk (nonsmokers). Farmers, gardeners, forestry workers, and fishermen had the lowest lung cancer risk (42.1 per 100,000 person-years) and a smoking frequency of 44.7%. Their I0 was 12.6 or 8.4 per 100,000 person-years, taking R for smoking as 6 or 10, respectively. From these I0 estimates, the expected rates for white- and blue-collar workers (smoking frequencies 52.7 and 57.7%, respectively) were 45.8 and 49.1 per 100,000 person-years, as compared with the 22% and 57% higher observed rates, respectively. Weighing these excesses proportionally according to the sizes of the three occupational categories gave, respectively for R equal to 6 and 10, occupation-related excesses of 39% and 32% and population-attributable risks of 28% and 24%. About one-fourth of the lung cancers that occur among economically active Swedish men seem to have been related to occupation. This figure agrees with estimates made by other methods in Nordic countries. Due to interaction, the population-attributable risk from smoking is still high, 73% and 83% at relative risk values of 6 and 10, respectively.",0355-3140,-1,"pubmed, embase","1402, 1193",,,,302

A variety of exposure–response functions were fitted to the cohort data using generalised relative risk models. Results: In 677 lung cancer cases there was a clear trend of increasing risk with increasing cumulative exposure to PAH measured as benzo(a)pyrene (BaP). A linear model predicted a relative risk of 1.35 (95% CI 1.22 to 1.51) at 100 μg/m−3 BaP years, but there was a significant departure from linearity in the direction of decreasing slope with increasing exposures.

Additive models and multiplicative models for combining risks from occupational PAH and smoking fitted almost equally well, with a slight advantage to the additive. Conclusion: Despite the large cohort with long follow-up, the shape of the exposure–response function and the mode of combination of risks due to occupational PAH and smoking remains uncertain.

In Peru several studies have been published regarding the PAF of various risk factors and their associated diseases. The objective of this study was to estimate the fraction of cancer cases and deaths attributable to potentially modifiable risk factors in Peru in 2018, before the COVID-19 pandemic in the population of 15 years old and older. Methods: An ecological study was conducted using the prevalence of exposure of the Peruvian population to modifiable risk factors for cancer, the relative risk associated with each factor, and the number of cancer cases and deaths in 2018 as inputs. We used the Parkin formula with a Montecarlo statistical simulation model to calculate the PAF and confidence intervals. The number of new cancer cases and deaths attributed to each risk factor was determined by multiplying the number of cases and deaths in each gender by the PAF of each risk factor. Findings: In Peru, 38.5% of new cases (34.5% in men and 42% in women) and 43.4% of cancer-related deaths (43.4% in men and 43.4% in women) were attributable to modifiable risk factors. The number of cancers attributable was 25,308 (10,439 in men and 14,869 in women) and the number of deaths attributable to cancer was 14,839 (6,953 in men and 7,886 in women). The predominant modifiable risk factors contributing to the highest number of cases and deaths were HPV infection (4,563 cases, 2,409 deaths), current tobacco use (3,348 cases, 2,180 deaths), and helicobacter pylori infection (2,677 cases, 1,873 deaths). Among the risk factors, oncogenic infections constituted the group with the highest PAF (16.6% for cases, 19.2% for deaths) followed by other unhealthy lifestyle factors (14.2% for cases, 16.7% for deaths), tobacco (7.2% for cases, 7.2% for deaths) and ultraviolet radiation (0.5% for cases, 0.3% for deaths). Conclusions: Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 38.5% of cancer cases and 43.4% of cancer-related deaths in Peru were linked to modifiable risk factors in the population of 15 years old and older. Most preventable cancer cases and deaths were related to oncogenic infections, primarily caused by HPV and helicobacter pylori, followed by tobacco and obesity.",1471-2407,-1,embase,1001,,,,305

The histologic pattern of the tumor and the presence or absence of pleural plaques or asbestosis were noted. Fiber analysis was performed in 619 cases, using the sodium hypochlorite technique for digestion of lung tissue samples. Asbestos bodies were counted by light microscopy (LM) and coated and uncoated fibers by scanning electron microscopy (EM). The results were stratified over four decades. Trends that were observed included increasing patient age, increasing percentage of women, increasing percentage of peritoneal cases, and increasing percentage of epithelial histological type. There was a decreasing trend in the percentage of patients with concomitant asbestosis (p < 0.001). The percentage of cases with an elevated lung asbestos content decreased from 90.5% in the 1980s to 54.1% in the 2010s (p < 0.001).

Stellman",1996,CA A Cancer Journal for Clinicians,10.3322/canjclin.46.2.70,Cancer and the workplace,70-92,46,2,"Although occupationally related cancers make up only a small fraction of all cancers, many environmental carcinogens have first been discovered in occupational settings. The estimate typically found in the scientific literature is that about two to eight percent of all human cancers are of occupational origin.1 However, by averaging the unexposed population in with the exposed, such estimates tend to obscure the heavy toll that occupational cancer can take on specific populations of exposed workers. Among persons actually exposed to carcinogens at work, risk estimates are much higher. For instance, Morabia et al2 have put the attributable risk for lung cancer at 9.2 percent for men employed in occupations characterized by exposure to established carcinogens. For bladder cancer, the population attributable risk from occupational exposures may exceed one case in five for men3 and one in ten for women.4 Indeed, despite the relatively small ""contribution"" that occupational cancer makes to the total cancer burden, recognition and concern for cancers related to workplace exposures have been central themes in control of environmental carcinogens. There are several good reasons for this. One is the unique nature of the workplace, which serves as a focal point in which large numbers of people may be exposed to high concentrations of chemicals or other hazardous situations. Another is that the very nature of work creates a cohort for the kinds of epidemiologic studies described below that can help establish a cause-effect relationship between an environmental exposure and cancer. It is because of the exposures to large doses and the opportunities to implement effective procedures for risk assessment and control in the workplace that the study of occupational cancer plays so important a role in the control of cancer in general. Finally, perhaps the most important reason to identify occupational carcinogens and to elucidate their role in cancer causation is that occupational cancers are, for the most part, entirely preventable through appropriate engineering, personnel practices, and strict governmental protective legislation. The ultimate goal of collecting, evaluating, and disseminating data on carcinogenicity of occupational exposures is to develop strategies for prevention of disease. The most efficient strategy relies on primary prevention, that is, identification and elimination of sources of exposure. Secondary prevention through screening of asymptomatic illness plays a lesser role, but may still be valuable in specific workplaces. Recent advances in molecular biology have led to identification of tests that can identify workers exposed to various carcinogens. Such tests, however, are at present extremely expensive, and their predictive value is no greater than that of traditional industrial hygiene workplace evaluations. Occupational screening may have its greatest usefulness as a tool for educating workers to potential hazards in the workplace. Despite the fact that more than six million chemicals have already been identified and registered with the Chemical Abstracts Service and more than 50,000 are estimated to be regularly used in commerce, probably fewer than 1,000 chemicals or exposure situations have been scrutinized as to their potential for cancer causation.5 Even so, the literature on evaluation of cancer risks for even this small fraction of known exposures is massive and not altogether consistent for many specific substances. Estimation of actual cancer risks to humans requires careful sifting and evaluation of large quantities of data from many different studies. Since the early 1970s, an extensive effort has been made to systematize the available data on cancer risks. A comprehensive methodology for assessment of human cancer risks has been developed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) that draws on data from a variety of disciplines. The IARC methods, which are widely regarded as definitive, rely on the judgment of internationally recognized experts. Groups of scientists with expertise in various disciplines are convened to discuss and summarize the literature on individual carcinogens, groups of related carcinogens, or in some cases entire industries. These critical evaluations are ultimately presented as monographs, each of which contains a critical evaluation of the carcinogenicity of one or more target exposures. The evaluations take into account many different types of information, including data from epidemiology, experimental studies on rodents and other laboratory animals, in vitro studies where appropriate, and other relevant data including toxicity, metabolism, genotoxicity, and metabolic studies. According to the IARC, ""Each monograph consists of a brief description of the chemical and physical properties of the agent; methods for its analysis; a description of the methods and volumes of production and use; data on occurrence and human exposure; summaries of case reports and epidemiologic studies of cancer in humans; summaries of experimental carcinogenicity tests; a brief description of other relevant biologic data, such as toxicity and genetic effects, that may indicate its possible mechanism of action; and an evaluation of its carcinogenicity.""6 Because the IARC periodically revises its evaluations to reflect accumulation of new data and evolution of methods of assessment, the information in these monographs is generally current and forms the basis of the summary tables in this paper. The IARC classifies the evidence for carcinogenicity of specific exposures into four categories: sufficient, limited, or inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity or evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity. Sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity implies that a causal relationship has been established between exposure to the agent, mixture, or exposure circumstance and human cancer and that chance, bias, and confounding have been ruled out with reasonable confidence. Limited evidence of carcinogenicity implies that a positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent, mixture, or exposure circumstance and cancer for which a causal interpretation is considered to be credible, but chance, bias, or confounding cannot be ruled out with reasonable confidence. Inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity means that the available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency, or statistical power to permit a conclusion regarding the presence or absence of a causal association or that no data on cancer in humans are available. Evidence suggesting lack of carcinogenicity means that there are several adequate studies covering the full range of exposure levels that human beings are known to encounter that are mutually consistent in not showing a positive association between exposure to the agent and the studied cancer at any observed level of exposure. A set of criteria analogous to those for assessing risk in human studies is used to classify cancer risk even when definitive human data are not available. This process takes into account information from carcinogenesis bioassays and other experimental studies of animals along with toxicity and other biologic data. The expert committee deliberations take into account epidemiologic, animal, and other types of data, including in vitro and metabolic studies where appropriate, from which an overall assessment of carcinogenicity to humans is synthesized within a scheme that consists of four broad groups. To date, 61 volumes of IARC Monographs have been published, and 782 agents or exposure circumstances have been classified. The distribution of these 782 agents or exposure circumstances within the carcinogenicity groupings is shown in Table 1. Group 2, likely carcinogens, is subdivided into Group 2A, probably carcinogenic to humans, and Group 2B, possibly carcinogenic to humans. These categorizations take explicit note of the relevance of animal studies to human cancer risk and are most often used to classify substances for which human data may be limited or inadequate but where animal data are deemed sufficient and mechanistically relevant to humans (Group 2A) or less than sufficient but strongly supportive of existing human data (Group 2B). The seemingly large number of agents denoted as carcinogenic or probably carcinogenic (Groups 1 and 2A, N=117) is a reflection of the selection process for inclusion in the monographs. Agents are generally evaluated only when substantial data bases already exist. These data bases, in turn, have usually evolved over a period of years in response to concerns of industry, workers, or the public. Tables 2 and 3 present the IARC Monograph groupings of known and probable human carcinogens (Groups 1 and 2A) and typical uses or occurrences.7 Table 4 summarizes occupational exposure situations that have been classified as falling into Groups 1, 2A, and 2B. The history of occupational cancer identification and control has been recounted by many authors.8 The potential for work-related cancers has been recognized at least since the work of Ramazzini in the sixteenth century, and in fact our modern understanding of the influence of environmental factors on human cancer is due in large measure to occupational studies, ironically many of them drawn from the exposures of people in the health care professions. Examination of the known and probable occupational carcinogens and exposure situations, given in Tables 2 to 4, reveals a number that are found in health care situations and for which work practices are still inadequate to protect health care personnel with potential exposures. X-rays provide a good case study. Much of the knowledge about the dangers of the industrial use of x-rays is based on the ""lamentable history"" of the pioneers in the medical field, according to occupational medicine pioneer Donald Hunter.9 The first death recognized to be the result of the action of x-rays occurred in 1914 to the Italian radiologist, Emilio Tiraboschi. By 1922 at least one hundred radiologists had died from malignant diseases arising from their occupation. Much of the natural course of radiation poisoning was elucidated by following the progression of disease among these early victims. It is estimated that many hundreds of people have died as a result of occupational exposures to medical x-rays. The recognition of the potential deadliness of exposure to x-rays led to the relatively early establishment of national and international regulatory bodies, such as the International Commission on Radiological Protection, which was formed in 1928. Important safety concepts, such as maximum permissible dose, appropriate design and control of x-ray equipment, and basic principles for the elimination of unnecessary exposures, were developed over the years, along with systems of administrative control for registration and surveillance of people occupationally exposed to radiation. In many ways the control of exposure to x-rays is a paradigm for the basic principles for prevention of occupational cancer. The primary means of prevention is to reduce exposure to x-rays. This is facilitated by providing equipment designed to be as safe as possible and by testing and maintaining the equipment on a specified schedule. Exposure is also minimized through the use of appropriate shielding. Other preventive measures include administrative procedures to control potential exposures and rigorous programs of registration and surveillance (medical record keeping and exposure monitoring by radiation badges). All personnel who work with x-rays must receive training, and some job categories require specific licensure. A regulatory structure provides guidance and specifies the minimum legal requirements. Unlike the medical use of x-rays, which represents a paradigm for proper engineering and administrative controls in the use of dangerous substances, the mixing and administration of cancer chemotherapeutic agents provide an example of working conditions that have in many cases remained poorly conceived and controlled. The toxicity of drugs used as antineoplastics is well documented, yet until 1979, when a serendipitous experiment revealed elevated levels of mutagens in the urine of nurses who administer the drugs,10 no routine precautions were taken to prevent potential exposure, particularly to pharmacy and nursing staff. The major route for possible exposure arises from the aerosolization of drugs during mixing and administration. The presence of a vacuum in the syringe in which drugs are dissolved and from which they are administered leads to an imperceptible spraying of droplets unless a special ""blow-back"" device is used. Other preventive methods for avoiding contamination include the use of chemical hoods to provide exhaust ventilation during mixing and the use of personal protective equipment — such as disposable gloves, masks, and clothing — during drug administration. Such precautions are straightforward, yet they are not routinely followed in all health care settings. Indeed, as the number of patients requiring treatment with cancer chemotherapeutic agents grows and as the availability of in-hospital facilities decreases, one can envision that the possibilities of occupational exposures will increase rather than decrease. Despite the extreme biologic potency of antineoplastic drugs, including carcinogenicity, and the large number of antineoplastic agents that appear on the IARC lists of known and probable human carcinogens, no regulations requiring safe handling procedures have been promulgated, although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) published guidelines a few years after the exposure became widely recognized.11 This is in sharp contrast to the rapid growth of information, training, and regulation to control unnecessary exposure to medical x-rays. Thus, the extent of current exposure among health care personnel to these drugs is not known. While most major academic medical centers have, in fact, incorporated the recommended OSHA guidelines into their routine practices, many situations still exist in physician offices and among professionals who provide treatment at patient homes, for example, in which staff may be unnecessarily exposed to these drugs. Identification of human carcinogens in an occupational setting is a laborious and time-consuming process. Accumulation of enough evidence to classify a chemical or exposure as Group 1 can take years or decades. The process is an ongoing one, and lists such as those in Tables 2 to 4 are always incomplete because (1) established exposures are periodically reevaluated as more data become available and as industrial practices and hence exposure situations shift and (2) new chemicals and exposures are constantly being introduced into the workplace. Thus, health professionals, and clinicians in particular, must be alert to the changing spectrum of workplace exposures and the possibility that new exposure situations will lead to shifts in existing patterns of disease and perhaps to new occupational cancer hazards. The process of identifying or confirming suspected hazards is often carried out through epidemiologic studies, and cancer risk is usually expressed in epidemiologic terms. Controversies over published studies often involve sharp differences in interpretation of data or criticism of methodology. Therefore, to provide a sound basis for interpreting such studies, it is useful to review the basic epidemiologic strategies that have been and continue to be used to study and to quantify the impact of cancer in the workplace. This brief overview is intended to improve understanding of some of the concepts and tables in this article. It is not meant to replace the many existing treatises on epidemiology and occupational studies that are available.12–14 The goal of a workplace epidemiologic study is to relate an occupational exposure to a health outcome, such as a specific type of cancer. Direct measurement of exposure, though a desirable goal, is rarely achieved. Few workplaces systematically monitor the work environment for hazardous chemicals. In those that do, it is unusual to have records that cover the entire time period during which exposure may have affected development of cancer. It is far more common for exposure to be defined qualitatively, through classification of workers according to job title, work location, or industry of employment. For studies based solely on death certificates, the recorded occupation and/or industry serves as an exposure surrogate. In recent years occupational studies have frequently used industrial hygienists to help reconstruct likely exposure scenarios. In addition, a technique that uses a ""job exposure matrix"" has been developed to assign probable exposures to various combinations of occupations and industries of employment.15 Finally, exposure to toxic chemicals is sometimes estimated from human-derived measurement of the chemicals themselves, their metabolites, or other effects of their interaction with biologic materials, such as adducts with DNA. These methods are collectively known as biomarker methods.16 While biomarker methods are becoming increasingly popular, their reliability still remains to be fully established, chiefly because they usually require extrapolation from current or relatively recent measurements to exposures that may have taken place in the distant past when carcinogenic effects may have, in fact, been more relevant. The appearance of a highly unusual cancer, such as angiosarcoma of the liver in chemical workers or scrotal cancer in chimneysweeps,17 or the appearance of an otherwise common cancer among a group ordinarily at low risk, such as lung cancer in very young workers exposed to bis (chloromethyl) ether, is termed a signal cancer. The first identified chemical carcinogen, β-naphthylamine, was discovered in 1895 after an astute clinician reported a large excess of bladder cancer in chemical dye industry workers.18,19 Vinyl chloride was first identified as a human carcinogen following reports of angiosarcoma of the liver in chemical workers. Animal studies showing carcinogenicity of vinyl chloride appeared at about the same time as the case reports.20 Angiosarcoma of the liver is so rare that few physicians ever see such a patient in a lifetime of practice, yet three workers were diagnosed in a brief period in a tire plant in Kentucky in 1974.21 Bis (chloromethyl) ether, an unwanted by-product in the production of polymeric resins, was initially reported in 1971 as a lung carcinogen by a pulmonary physician at a local hospital serving the area of residence of many Rohm & Haas workers in Philadelphia,22 but only after the workers themselves identified a number of their colleagues who had contracted the disease.23 A signal cancer is a special case of a sentinel health event, which was defined by Rutstein et al24 as a preventable disease, disability, or untimely death whose occurrence serves as a warning signal of a potentially hazardous situation that may require investigation and correction. The discovery of a signal or sentinel cancer, if promptly and properly followed up, can result in identification and elimination of an unsuspected hazard. However, sentinel health events rarely occur, and workplace cancer hazards are more often discovered through clinical observations and traditional epidemiologic methods. It should be noted that unlike many current epidemiologic investigations, which focus on ""weak associations"" (i.e., those characterized by a risk increase smaller than twofold), many of the occupational carcinogens in Tables 2 and 3 were originally recognized because their effects were sufficiently large to be noticeable at the clinical level. All modern countries systematically collect data on cause of death in their population. Ecologic studies are built on the hypothesis that workers in specific industries may have higher rates of cancer than the general population. By comparing cancer death rates in those industries with population rates of the same cancers, conclusions as to whether workers are at increased risk can be drawn. The advantage of this type of analysis is that it makes use of existing death records and, therefore, requires no new data acquisition — provided occupational information is available. The drawback is that such data normally do not contain any information about exposures of individuals to specific substances. The primary contribution of this descriptive epidemiology is to uncover new associations between particular occupations or industries and disease. The drawback of ecologic methods is that they are very weak tools that are inadequate to establish cause-effect relationships.25 Stronger methods require comparison of cancer risks between groups of people with and without established exposures. These are often provided by analytic methods such as cohort and case-control studies. In Great Britain, the Registrar-General (equivalent to the National Center for Health Statistics in the United States) has published ""Decennial Supplements"" to the vital statistics reports that specifically compare age-adjusted death rates of workers in various occupations and industries with each other and with the general population.26 These valuable reports have identified, for instance, the high rate of lung cancer in woodworkers, which has been confirmed in other studies.27 In the Nordic countries, where citizens are assigned identification numbers that are used in a variety of governmental data systems, census data can be linked electronically with occupational data and with cancer registration data to permit direct calculation of cancer rates in workers in specific industries. A number of studies of occupational cancer have been published on workers in Denmark,28 Norway,29 and Sweden.30 By linking census data with national cancer registries, a collaborative group found increased risks for bladder and lung cancer in hairdressers in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden.31 The most common types of epidemiologic studies are those in which exposures and health outcomes are determined for individuals. Many treatises now exist that explain the application of analytic epidemiology to occupational cancer.32–36 The two study methodologies most commonly encountered are cohort studies and case-control studies. In ideal circumstances, they ought to yield equivalent results, but in practice the availability of workers and the quality of work-related records and/or measurements usually dictate choice of study design. In a typical cohort or follow-up study, a group of workers with some common characteristic, such as employment in a target industry or well-characterized exposure to a known hazardous substance, is identified as of a specific time and their vital status (in a mortality study) or cancer occurrence (in an incidence study) is ascertained as of a later time. Subjects may be identified through records and followed into the present or future (a design sometimes called retrospective), or they may be identified currently and followed up prospectively. The classic studies of Selikoff et al37 on asbestos insulation workers that linked asbestos exposure to cancer of the lung and other sites were of this design. Occupational cohorts have been used to investigate the etiology of cancer in workers exposed to sulfuric acid mists,38 in rubber workers,39 and in workers occupationally exposed to formaldehyde.40 Cancer risk as determined by a cohort study is commonly expressed as a standard incidence ratio (SIR) or standard mortality ratio (SMR), depending on whether the outcome is a newly diagnosed cancer or cancer death. The simplest SIR (or SMR) is calculated as the number of observed cases (or deaths) in a population exposed to a suspected carcinogen divided by the number expected based on rates in an unexposed population (the reference or control group). SIRs and SMRs are usually adjusted statistically for possible confounding factors, most commonly age. Table 5 shows the lung cancer SMRs calculated for white male workers and white female workers in a South Carolina textile plant where chrysotile asbestos was the primary exposure.41 The analysis was restricted to workers at least 15 years since first exposure to allow for the fact that cancers may develop many years after first exposure. The gradual increase in the SMR associated with an increase in the estimated fiber concentration is typical of a dose-response relationship and is a key piece of evidence in favor of a causal relationship. A similar dose-response relationship was observed for mortality from pneumoconiosis, a noncancer outcome, which increases confidence that the lung cancer observation is real and not a reporting artifact. There are many studies where numbers of cancer deaths are available from death certificates, but SMRs cannot be computed because of lack of other essential data on the population at risk. In such studies a proportional mortality ratio (PMR) is computed by comparing the ratio each type of cancer makes to the total number of deaths in the exposed population with similar ratios in a reference population, adjusted for age. This method, which gives a surprisingly good idea of excesses or deficits in various types of cancer, has the drawback that because all proportions must add to 100 percent, a PMR for one particular cause may artificially appear to be very high or very low if some other common cause of death, such as heart disease, is unusually high or low in the study population. Nevertheless, the PMR method is well accepted as an inexpensive and valid way to obtain a first look at a possible cancer problem. In the United States, the ready availability of death certificates, many of which list the industry and occupation of the decedent, makes PMR analysis a useful screen for unexpected cancer risks. The US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health supports an occupationally coded data base of death certificates containing nearly five million entries. This data base has been used to evaluate age-adjusted and race-specific PMRs for women in eleven broad occupational groupings and over 400 specific occupations.42,43 For both white and black women, significantly elevated lung cancer PMRs were noted for the categories of executive-managerial, technician, sales, administrative support (clerical), precision production, and operator-laborer. This large-scale methodology makes it possible to detect increases in risk within occupational groups for which other types of analytic studies are impractical or impossible because women are typically employed in many small workplaces that would be difficult to identify individually. Table 6 shows the occupations listed on death certificates for white women younger than 65 years and for which the PMR was significantly above 140. These included, for instance, sheet metal and construction workers, many of whom have documented exposure to asbestos,44 and waitresses and bartenders, among whom the prevalence of cigarette smoking is higher than for many other occupations.45 A case-control study is conducted by identifying subjects who already have contracted or died of a specific disease and comparing their exposures with exposures of subjects diagnosed with some other disease or with no disease at all. A case-control study has the advantage of being highly efficient for study of rare diseases such as cancer. It has two major weaknesses. First, by definition it can be used to investigate only one disease outcome, whereas cohort studies provide information about practically all observable health outcomes. Second, case-controls studies are limited by the frequency with which subjects with specific occupations present at hospitals or die within the geographic area where the study is carried out. The people who make up the cases may be identified through hospital canvass or by examining local or regional tumor registries and subsequently interviewed. Cases may also be constructed by selecting decedents from death certificate registries, in which case exposure information is ordinarily restricted to information recorded on the death certificate, although interviews with family members are sometimes conducted. The case-control design has been used to study bladder cancer, for which occupational risks arise in chemical and other industries,46–48 and lung cancer in shipyard workers, many of whom have been exposed to high levels of asbestos.49 Cancer risks ascertained in case-control studies are commonly expressed by means of an odds ratio, which is a statistical estimate of the relative risk. Blot and Fraumeni50 combined data from four case-control studies of lung cancer in relation to cigarette smoking and shipyard work and reported a relative risk of 21.7 for men employed as shipyard workers who smoked at least two packs of cigarettes per day and a relative risk of 10.3 for men who were not shipyard workers but smoked two packs a day. The reference group (relative risk, 1.0) was nonsmoking, nonshipyard workers. Case-control studies are less frequently used to screen occupations and industries for increased risk, but the availability of large data files has improved the feasibility of this approach. Cantor et al51 examined death certificates covering over 59,000 female breast cancer deaths in 24 states from 1984 through 1989 that were coded for occupation and industry. They used noncancer deaths from the same data base as a comparison group. After adjusting for age and socioeconomic status, they reported suggestive associations for probability and level of exposure for styrene, several organic solvents (methylene chloride, carbon tetrachloride, and formaldehyde), several metals/metal oxides, and acid mists. Such associations would have to be investigated in specific workplaces before causal inferences",0007-9235 1542-4863,-1,openalex,1550,,,,307

Selecting high risk population for LDCT screening is a key issue for lung cancer screening. Many studies have suggested that lung cancer risk model which incorporating these factors can be more accurate to identify high risk individuals suitable for LDCT screening than the NLST criteria[2]. Thus, more precise evaluation of association between these factors are warranted to developing lung cancer risk models. In this study, we developed and internal validated a lung cancer risk model with data of a occupational screening cohort in Yunnan, China with the aim to exploring potential improvement of yield of lung cancer screening with Chest X-ray and Sputum cytology due to the improved risk stratification. This study was a prospective occupational cohort study among tin miners from Yunnan Tin Corporation (YTC) initiated in 1992[3]. Participants were tin miners aged 40 or over and had at least 10 years of underground work or smelting history. Participants also had received annual lung screening from 1992 to 1999, and were annually followed up through December 31, 2001. Previous studies suggested that age, education level, smoking, occupational radon and arsenic exposure, prior chronic bronchitis were risk factors of lung cancer risk in this cohort[4-6]. During the study period, a total of 443 lung cancer deaths were confirmed among 9295 participants. To reduce the potential information bias, 69 lung cancer death with 1 year since enrollment were not included into the analysis. To stratified those with higher lung cancer risk, we increased the age criteria from 40 to 50 years old(model 0), then further developed three risk prediction models with multivariate logistic regression respectively, and the predicted probability of lung cancer death for each participants were also calculated based on logistic regression model respectively(table1). The goodness of fit, discrimination and calibration ability of the model performance were evaluated with -2log likelihood, area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) (C-index) and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. We found that the model incorporated age, gender, smoking, educational prior chronic bronchitis, occupational radon and arsenic had the best discrimination performance with area under ROC as of 0.821(95%CI:0.805-0.836) (figure1a). The calibration performance of this model was also good(Hosmer–Lemeshow type χ2=5.413,p=0.773)(figure1b). The areas under ROC curve of model 2 and model 3 were significantly better than those of model1 and model 0(all p<0.001), however, no difference was found between model 2 and model 3. Besides, Bootstrapping techniques were used for internal validation of the model 3 to Correct for this overfit or optimism, and discrimination C-statistic from C-statics was the same to the original data. We stratified the participants into 4 quintiles for the predicted risk of death from lung cancer. The cumulative lung cancer death rate from quintile 1 with lowest risk to quintile 4 having the highest risk increased from 11.51, 47.66, 625.41 to 1732.37 per 105 person-years, while only 2.5% of all lung cancer deaths were in quintile 1 and 2. Similarly, in 210 screen-detected lung cancer deaths, the proportion in quintile 1 and 2 was only 2.4%. In conclusion, we have developed and internal validated a lung cancer risk model based on personal and occupation covariates in this occupational population, and this model showed good accuracy for the identification of lung cancer and might assist in identifying individuals at high risk of developing lung cancer in lung cancer screening in this occupational cohort.

They assert that asbestos ranks among the most important occupational carcinogens and advocate for the elimination of asbestos-related diseases (ARDs) through the cessation of asbestos use. Their recent focus has centred on chrysotile asbestos [1], the single fibre type traded globally and applied industrially since around the 1990s. This implicit endorsement of a worldwide asbestos ban has seen implementation in over 60 countries, although the majority are economically developed. As a result, there has been a noteworthy reduction in global raw asbestos consumption to approximately 1.2 million metric tonnes per year [2]. Despite this progress, the manufacturing and consumption of asbestos-cement construction materials persist at substantial per capita levels, especially in developing Asian countries. Notably, the recent momentum in countries adopting asbestos bans appears to be waning. Materials and Methods This presentation consolidates existing knowledge and accumulated experience regarding the current global spread of ARDs, explores the implications of their under-recognition, and re-evaluates strategies for effective policy-making. Results 1. Asbestos-Related Diseases (ARDs) Malignant mesothelioma develops predominantly on the pleura, and to a lesser extent, on the peritoneum, with an attributable fraction of 90% or more. As such mesothelioma is widely accepted as the “indicator disease” related to asbestos. It is one of the most fatal human cancers with limited treatment options. Although relatively rare, it is rapidly increasing and diagnosis proves challenging in developing countries. Asbestos-related lung cancer (ARLC) has an attributable fraction of about 10% but is anticipated to surpass mesothelioma by 6-times in terms of cases. The Helsinki Criteria for Diagnosis and Attribution [3] serve as the standard reference for diagnosing ARLC, but its diagnosis is also challenging in developing countries. An essential characteristic of ARDs is their long latency period following asbestos exposure, reaching 30-40 years or longer, particularly with mesothelioma. Regarding causality, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), through extensive literature reviews, consistently concludes that there is sufficient evidence to establish that asbestos causes human cancer [4]. Various national and international authorities align in designating asbestos as a human carcinogen. Prominent international scientific bodies like the International Commission on Occupational Health (ICOH) [5] and the Collegium Ramazzini [6] have long advocated for a global asbestos ban recognizing the insurmountable human costs associated with its use. 2. Global Burden of ARDs Mesothelioma deaths are reported to the WHO by various countries, but the quality and availability of data are roughly proportional to a country’s national income level [7]. This is due to the challenge of diagnosing mesothelioma, coupled with a general lack of socio-medical infrastructure as well as awareness, particularly in less developed countries. Statistical data on ARLC deaths are scarce, and even among developed countries, comparisons are challenging. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Study for 2019 [8] estimates that annual deaths caused by occupational exposure to asbestos total 239,000, of which 236,000 are all cancers, 199,000 are lung cancer (ARLC), and 27,000 are mesothelioma. Asia is of particular concern, as the estimated numbers of mesothelioma deaths of Asia show a faster increasing trend than other regions. This pattern is expected because a number of Asian developing countries, including densely populated ones, have consistently reported high levels of asbestos consumption. While GBD estimates are considered authoritative, there is considerable uncertainty regarding ARDs, especially in less developed countries. 3. Ecological Relationships – Evidence for Policy The continued substantial use of asbestos in many developing countries underscores the need for innovative approaches alongside conventional methods that emphasise accumulation and dissemination of evidence on causality. Ecological relationships, drawn from country-level data, provide supporting evidence for national policies. In our 2022 study [9] covering 198 countries, we found that the historical burden of mesothelioma deaths and their identification often prompted countries to ban asbestos. A straightforward 2 by 2 analysis revealed that most countries banning asbestos had identified mesothelioma, while twice as many non-banning countries did not identify mesothelioma. Similarly, countries not identifying mesothelioma were less likely to ban asbestos. The estimated mortality rate of mesothelioma was highest in the subgroup where asbestos was banned and mesothelioma was identified, with a decreasing gradient towards the subgroup where asbestos was not banned, and mesothelioma was not identified. The National Asbestos Profile (NAP), an annexed template to the WHO/ILO National Program for the Elimination of Asbestos-Related Disease, allows countries to measure progress towards eliminating ARDs and discontinuing asbestos use. Our 2021 global survey [10] found that only 14 countries formulated the NAP, including three high-income countries that had already banned asbestos. Encouragingly, eight lower middle-income countries, still using asbestos, developed the NAP. Despite being nderutilized, this tool holds significant potential for countries to learn from other countries and assess their own status. Training workshops, often coordinated with the WHO, the ILO and the United Nations Environmental Programme, have raised awareness and facilitated technology development in asbestos-using countries. The University of Occupational and Environmental Health, Japan (UOEH) and the Asbestos and Dust Diseases Research Institute of Australia (ADDRI) have been enduring leaders. In the post-COVID-19 era, the challenge for asbestos-using countries is to rekindle stakeholder interest and regain momentum towards positive transitions. The ADDRI has additionally created the e-Toolkit for Eliminating ARDs in Developing Countries accessible at https://adri.org.au/whocc/etoolkit-2021/. This resource offers a rich collection of educational text, along with hyperlinks to valuable external sources and originally developed educational videoclips. To ensure maximum accessibility, these videos are now captioned with the 6 UN languages (Arabic, Chinese, English, French, Russian and Spanish). Conclusions Despite ongoing calls from UN Organizations for countries to eliminate ARDs and discontinue asbestos use, the recent pace of asbestos bans seems to be decelerating. The majority of the global burden of ARDs remains concealed, with estimations presenting significant concerns, particularly in developing Asian countries. Various countermeasures designed to facilitate the implementation of asbestos bans by countries have yet to be fully deployed. Drawing on acquired knowledge and experience, the presenters suggest prioritizing the identification of mesothelioma cases (i.e., the indicator disease) and the formulation of NAP in training curricula that target countries continuing to use asbestos. Efforts must be intensified to bolster global awareness ",0962-7480 1471-8405,abstract_added,openalex,1774,,,,313

Mean atmospheric concentrations were 47.9-50.2 mg/m3, but only 0.08-1.82% of the dusts retained fibrous morphology during the dissemination procedure which involved hammer milling. Trace contamination especially by chromium and nickel was also increased. Light microscopic fiber counts per ml chamber air were 54 (chrysotile), 1105 (crocidolite), and 864 (amosite). A fibrogenic response to these dusts was observed in all five animal species, the severity corresponding to the extent of exposure (with reaction to chrysotile frequently very slight). Gerbils developed frequent alveolar proteinosis. Mice developed spontaneous papillary carcinomas in the lungs. Disregarding the latter species, carcinogenic response to asbestos inhalation was restricted to rats and occurred in all three exposure groups. There were 2 lung cancers and 1 pleural mesothelioma after chrysotile inhalation; 4 lung cancers after crocidolite inhalation; and 1 lung cancer and 2 pleural mesotheliomas after amosite inhalation. These cases constituted 7-9% incidence of malignancy among rats with adequate survival record. Hypotheses of asbestos carcinogenesis are reviewed and it is suggested that different etiologic principles may be involved in the causation of lung cancer and of pleural mesothelioma.",0013-9351,-1,embase,1287,,,,314
145,1675,Sven Hernberg,1998,Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health,10.5271/sjweh.294,Inconclusive cancer epidemiology,161-164,24,3,"How often or not is the main message of an original epidemiologic article the old cliché ""further research is needed""? Sometimes the literature is even so dominated by inconclusive or contradictory articles that comprehensive reviews have to come to the same conclusion. In this issue we see two examples. One of them states that, although much research has been published, it is not possible to clearly identify environmental or work-related etiologies for ovarian cancer (1). Except for tobacco smoking, the same appears to be true for pancreatic cancer (2). In an earlier review a similar conclusion was reached for breast cancer (3). There are several other cancers for which environmental or occupational etiologies have been suggested but for which the evidence is inconclusive. Stomach, colorectal, and prostatic cancer can serve as examples. On the other hand, there are indeed cancers for which strong environmental etiologic factors have been identified by epidemiologic research, for example, lung cancer, sinonasal cancer and primary liver cancer. Many hundreds of chemical, physical, biological and life-style factors have been reviewed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer, but its expert teams have only been able to classify fewer than 100 chemicals, work processes, or other environmental factors as human carcinogens. Several others have been classified as probable or possible carcinogens, but in the vast majority of the evaluations the evidence was inadequate. And even when carcinogens have been identified, they usually explain only part of the etiology of a particular tumor. The problem is usually a lack of literature in general, and epidemiologic literature in particular, and even if the latter exists, it is all too often limited, confusing, contradictive or inconclusive. Why is it that a review of the epidemiologic literature can so seldom reach definite conclusions? There are several reasons. One could be that no major environmental or work-related risk factors for the cancer in question really exist. When this is the case, some studies may turn out ""positive"" and others ""negative"" by pure chance, especially if the population under study is small. Alternatively, environmental or work-related risk factors could be too weak (biologically) or the exposure levels too low to be detectable by the rather crude tool that epidemiologic research provides. However, the well-known geographic differences in cancer occurrence suggest that these alternatives are not sufficient explanations. The literature may also be inconclusive due to the methodological problems inherent in epidemiologic research, weaknesses that even the best of researchers cannot overcome. Such problems include lack of retrospective exposure data, difficulties in finding large enough study populations, and so forth, as discussed later. A further explanation may be our poor understanding of the mechanism of action of many carcinogens, for example, are early or late stages of carcinogenesis involved, or both, and what is the interaction with genetic factors. Knowledge of such mechanisms would help focus studies on vulnerable population groups and the most informative time windows. Different histological subtypes of cancers should ideally also be studied separately, but this approach often requires much larger populations than those available. These are convenient explanations for epidemiologists because they blame ""natural"" factors and not the skills of the researchers. But is this the whole truth? No, it is not. Too much poor and unnecessary research is still being carried out and published. This was, in fact, one of the conclusions of the review on ovarian cancer (1). Although the general rule in science is that only new and original ideas should be elaborated into a research project, epidemiologic research is somewhat different. It is inexact and prone to errors, and therefore other researchers' findings must be corroborated or disproved. Clarification is especially needed when the literature is inconclusive or contradictory. But this need for clarification does not give us a green light to initiate whatever project whenever. The key issue is whether a new study really will be better than earlier attempts. Then, and only then, does the problem have a chance of being solved; otherwise the new endeavor only adds to the confusion. Sometimes a new project can indeed beat earlier ones, for example, if the researchers have access to a unique population with good exposure data, if their competence is high, or if they can apply new and better methodology, for example, in exposure assessment. If so, there is good reason to carry out the study. More often however replicating earlier studies does not lead anywhere. Then replicative research is not warranted. Even if the idea is original, scientifically sound, and important, many ""natural"" shortcomings typical of epidemiologic research may spoil a project. Very often the population available is too small, especially when it comes to the number of truly informative individuals (ie, those who have been highly exposed long enough and many years ago). The situation is especially problematic whenever the turnover of the work force is high and exposures occur mainly in small workplaces. In the era of meta-analysis, a small population is not completely useless, however, provided the study is otherwise sound. Nevertheless, small studies are in general uninformative when regarded alone. Another ""natural"" shortcoming is a mixed exposure pattern. Mixed exposure patterns can render the results of a study uninterpretable. Such patterns are a fact of life, not a flaw in study design, but prudent researchers avoid such constellations if the issue is the carcinogenicity of a single agent. Sometimes this is not possible, for example, when the issue is exposure to pesticides or cytostatic drugs. The exposure could also be too low to cause detectable effects, or it could affect almost everyone (eg, dietary factors, food residues); in such cases sufficient exposure contrasts are difficult to achieve. Measuring exposure accurately is necessary in epidemiologic research, and failure to do so has ruined many studies. The problem is that reliable retrospective exposure data very often do not exist. In the absence of such data, the exposure must be assessed. However, retrospective exposure assessment is an educated guess, even at best. Using occupational titles as the only proxy for exposure is far too crude an approach, with or without register linkage, as the authors of one of the reviews in this issue points out (1). All too many studies have used this approach, which has led to much confusion. Such studies should no longer be published. Using crude exposure data or poor proxies leads to nondifferential misclassification of exposure, which is strongly effect-masking in case-referent studies. A nondifferential misclassification rate as low as 10% lowers the estimate of the odds ratio by almost half (4). In case-referent studies focusing on distant time periods, the misclassification rate is often probably even far higher. How much faith can then be put into such odds ratios, and how can odds ratios obtained from different studies be compared if the degree of misclassification in various studies is different or if it cannot even be assessed? Likewise, how can rate ratios or standardized mortality ratios (SMR) of cohort studies with poorly documented and probably highly different exposure levels be compared in a review? It has long been known that SMR values from different studies should not be directly compared, because they have not been mutually standardized. Still, they are compared, without hesitation, in most meta-analyses. Different levels of exposure can of course in principle be accounted for, but how can one do this when exposure data are missing or weak? When such studies are reviewed, a meta-analysis is probably even more problematic than a narrative review, because biased or incomparable risk estimates are formally forced into a single meta-risk estimate, which then becomes meta-biased. Hence, when researchers ponder whether or not they should initiate a project, especially if the literature is inconclusive, the availability of accurate and detailed exposure data is crucial. If good exposure data cannot be acquired, such a project will lead nowhere and should not be carried out at all. In some countries the cancer registers needed for good epidemiology do not exist, or their quality is low. In other countries data protection legislation hinders the use of registers for research. However, in these very same countries, exposure levels may still be high enough to cause measurable cancer risks, and the temptation to start a research project may be irresistible, although informative epidemiologic research may be difficult or impossible. Is it then worthwhile to start a project? Researchers' failure to realize that such, often unavoidable, limitations will render a study uninterpretable, even when carried out with technical skill, is one of the reasons why the literature becomes confused. One remedy would be for researchers and funding agencies to become much more critical when evaluating the prospects of a study to be informative. ""Sample size zero"" is surprisingly often the best study size. However, because the result of a study cannot be known with certainty in advance, the decision is not an easy one. Some chances have to be taken, but clear potential failures should be avoided. Scientific journals also share the responsibility of cleaning up the literature, but their possibility to act comes at a stage when much (unnecessary) work has already been done, and this is frustrating for everyone involved. As if these ""natural"" difficulties were not enough, researchers have, in addition, all too often violated good epidemiologic practice in matters that could and should have been controlled. When Kristensen prepared his classical reviews on work-related risk factors for cardiovascular disease, he first scored the articles into 5 categories according to quality (5). He found that a high score correlated closely with the magnitude of the risk estimate. In other words, the better studies were more sensitive in detecting an existing risk. The same is certainly true for cancer studies. A full list of the weaknesses that can be found in published studies due to lack of skill is too long to be recapitulated here. Let some examples suffice. In addition to neglecting the need for good exposure information, even if data would be available, important common errors include uncontrolled confounding, poor accuracy of the cancer diagnosis, use of referents who are not representative of the study base (such as the general population in cohort studies and dubious secondary study bases in case-referent studies), poor control of recall bias, poor control of selection, and many others. Especially the use of the general population as a reference category has created more confusion than most epidemiologists are willing to admit. (Why should they, because almost everyone has committed - and still commits - the sin of introducing this comparison bias, pseudoscientifically named the healthy-worker effect. My own record is not entirely clean, either.) The nested case-referent design, using a large study base with sufficient exposure contrasts (Note! Even unexposed people) overcomes the bias from the healthy-worker effect. Why not consider this alternative? Poor research should be avoided at all costs, and at least it should not be published. When it comes to publishing, so-called better journals function as gatekeepers, although with varying success. Their peer review process, together with a high rejection rate, helps improve the quality of what becomes published. However, all journals are not ""better"", and the wild growth of the number of periodicals guarantees that space is almost always available somewhere. Hence persistent authors will, in the end, find some journal willing to publish their mediocre study, and the literature becomes contaminated once again. Therefore, improving the quality of the research itself is more crucial than focusing on the rather hopeless task of completely preventing poor studies from being published. This approach is also more fruitful. Improving the quality of research is not only the responsibility of research institutions, but also of every individual researcher. Institutions must actively promote their researchers' skills. This is best done by providing positive incitements, such as giving financial support for training, creating an innovative atmosphere, and providing sufficient facilities. Courses in research methodology and other curricula should be organized - and attending them should be mandatory. Young researchers must also receive close attention from their superiors and be given personal guidance, even if it requires much time. Informal scientific discussions among colleagues, even if the topic is not directly related to the current project, are part of a fruitful learning process. Reading literature should be encouraged. Young researchers should first be incorporated into teams led by their seniors and not be given independent and difficult tasks too early in their career. Written guidelines for conducting good research can also help improve quality (6). In addition senior co-workers busy with administration and other duties should sometimes stop and ask themselves if their current multitude of tasks will, in the long run (or even sooner), cause them to lose touch with research. Hence continuous self-improvement is a must not only for younger researchers, but also for older ones. Besides - some people never become good researchers! They may become excellent in other fields, and sometimes a shift at an early stage in one's career is the best solution for everyone. Studies affected by serious errors should not be allowed to ""create confusion"" in reviews and meta-analyses. If the quality of the original studies is not well accounted for in reviews, and especially so in formal meta-analyses, it will be hard to rid the current literature of the confusion that is so typical. In other words, poor studies indeed should be neglected in reviews of all kinds. However, even more important than neglecting poor studies is producing good ones. Modern literature shows that improvement is underway. For example, many researchers have become aware of the importance of good exposure data, and methods for exposure assessment have shown much development. The same can be said of data analysis. In addition, the quality of published studies has improved. Thus, in spite of a ballast from the past (and to some extent also still from the present), the share of ""good"" studies in the aggregate is increasing. This is a promising trend, but not yet enough, because the challenges are becoming harder. Epidemiologic research is becoming more and more difficult as most major, easily detectable environmental and work-related cancer risks become identified. The focus is switching towards minor risks caused by weak carcinogens and low exposure levels, small etiologic fractions, exposure-response relationships, and interactions between the environment and genetic factors. Only good, that is, sensitive and valid, studies with enough statistical power can detect such factors. Concentrating research institutions' resources, in terms of funds, time and competent manpower, on relevant problems, selecting only study settings that can provide answers, and developing the skills of the researchers is what we now need for improving the quality of epidemiologic research and creating more comprehensible literature. When all this has succeeded, some time in the not too distant future, reviews and meta-analyses will hopefully reach more definite conclusions than those based on the literature available today. We may even be able to rule out environmental risk factors for some cancers.",0355-3140 1795-990X,-1,openalex,1675,,,,315

Although general population studies have also identified diesel exhaust as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, similar evidence in occupational cohorts has been primarily limited to studies based on job titles. In this study, we examine the association between quantitative metrics of diesel exhaust exposures and ischemic heart disease (IHD) mortality in the Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS) cohort. Methods: Analyses were performed on the 7857 male miners in the DEMS cohort who ever worked underground and were regularly exposed to diesel exhaust. We applied the parametric g-formula, to assess possible effects from interventions limiting exposure to respirable elemental carbon (REC), a surrogate for diesel exhaust exposure, while adjusting for time-varying employment status to address potential bias by the healthy worker survivor effect. We estimated the change in risk of IHD mortality resulting from a series of hypothetical interventions (including limits based on ACGIH recommendations) as compared to the observed risk. Results: There were 288 observed IHD mortality cases in the study sample. The risk ratio (RR) comparing risk under the hypothetical intervention of a 25 μg/m3 limit for average annual REC exposures, to the risk under the observed natural course, was 0.88 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.72 – 1.05). The RR comparing risk under an intervention setting REC to zero with the observed natural course was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.67 -1.08) corresponding to an attributable fraction of 14%.

Although an enormous study in the total number of subjects, the non-smoking subcohort consists only of 190 men firefighters in total, only two of which are cases. It also relies heavily on duration of employment as a firefighter as the sole indicator of exposure, although duration, being temporal, is heavily confounded by age, era of firefighting technology and protective equipment, composition of smoke, and prevalence of smoking habits both in the community and among firefighters. No analysis could be made of job assignment, which clarifies duration. It is not surprising that among smoking firefighters the risk of lung cancer is driven by smoking, as the more frequent and repeated exposure, rather than exposure to fire smoke or diesel exhaust. Any excess risk of lung cancer from these exposures is predictably small compared with the much greater risk conferred by cigarette smoking. However, the studies on which the pooled estimates are based lack detail on firefighting assignment and era and judging from the high reported smoking rates appear skewed in distribution to subjects who entered the fire service before the modern era. There is abundant evidence for a biologically significant effect of firefighting in the cohort literature, including trends consistent with exposure–response relationships for job assignment (which requires knowledge of firefighting practices) and era (associated with use of protective equipment, composition of fire smoke, and smoking prevalence).2 The contribution of firefighting-related exposures to risk among non-smoking or minimally-smoking firefighters is probably not negligible, as implied. With such small numbers and consequent low power (demonstrated by confidence interval in Table 3 of over an order of magnitude), one can only tentatively extrapolate risk to non-smoking firefighters. On the other hand, using the method introduced by Fletcher for attributing lung cancer risk to smoking in occupational cohorts4 derives an estimate of relative risk for non-smokers of about three, approximate but clearly in excess of a doubling.5 This is not an insignificant additional risk for individuals who are at no or low risk from smoking. Non-smoking firefighters are much more common in the fire service today than in the past, in part due to secular trends and in part due to the introduction of wellness programs. As a practical matter, the risk for this non-smoking group is also important in assessing causation for all firefighters in compensation programs in which the contribution of risk from occupation is compared with personal risk. Fair compensation is based on the civil legal standard of the weight of evidence (or “balance” of probabilities), not scientific certainty, which is difficult to prove and which under workers compensation and other legislation represents too high a bar. Indeed, some legal systems, such as the state of Pennsylvania, have adopted a standard other than strict causation, recognizing occupational exposures that “substantially contribute” to cancer risk. By any standard, more than doubling of a reference or community risk is a substantial contribution. This paper contributes to the literature on lung cancer risk among firefighters but does not rule out an elevation for non-smoking firefighters.",1076-2752 1536-5948,abstract_added,openalex,1644,,,,318

Some information in this regard comes from analysis of the fiber content of lung tissue by means of analytical electron microscopy. The author has had the opportunity to study the lung asbestos content of 396 cases of mesothelioma, including 28 peritoneal cases, by means of analytical scanning electron microscopy. The highest fiber levels occurred in patients who also had asbestosis, which was found in 12% of pleural and 43% of peritoneal cases. Elevated tissue asbestos content was identified in 87% of pleural and 75% of peritoneal cases. Peritoneal cases that are asbestos related have on average a higher lung fiber burden than pleural cases. Mesotheliomas in women have elevated tissue asbestos content in about 60% of cases, and many of these had a history of exposure as a household contact of an asbestos worker. The main fiber type identified in our series was amphibole, predominantly amosite. These fibers have been demonstrated to reach the target tissue, the pleura.

We reviewed the current literature on disease risk among fire fighters to compare findings and to infer magnitude of risk. A standard mortality ratio (SMR) of 200 is equal to an attributable risk of 100% of expected, sufficient to justify presumption in most workers' compensation systems that accept this. We therefore concentrated on risks that approach or exceed an SMR of 200 or an equivalent risk estimate, bearing in mind that confidence intervals around these estimates are wide. Based on the criteria for presumption of occupational risk, we suggest the following conclusions with respect to general presumption of risk: (1) Lung cancer: There is evidence for an association but not of sufficient magnitude for a general presumption of risk. (2) Cardiovascular. There is no evidence for an increased risk of death overall from heart disease. Sudden death, myocardial infarction, or fatal arrhythmia occurring on or soon after near-maximal stress on the job are likely to be heart related, but such ""heart attacks"" occurring away from work cannot be presumed to be work related. (3) Aortic aneurysm: The evidence is incomplete for an association, but if an association does exist, it would probably be of a magnitude compatible with a general presumption of risk. (4) Cancers of the genitourinary tract, including kidney, ureter, and bladder: The evidence is strong for both an association and for a general presumption of risk. (5) Cancer of brain: Incomplete evidence strongly suggests a possible association at a magnitude consistent with a general presumption of risk. (6) Cancer of lymphatic and hematopoietic tissue: By group, there is some evidence for both an association and a general presumption or risk. However, the aggregation is medically meaningless. We therefore recommend a case-by-case approach. (7) Cancer of the colon and rectum: There is sufficient evidence to conclude that there is an association but not that there is a general presumption of risk. (8) Acute lung disease: Unusual exposures, such as exposure to the fumes of burning plastics, can cause severe lung toxicity and even permanent disability. This does not appear to result in an increased lifetime risk of dying from chronic lung disease.",1076-2752,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1439, 1231, 1525",,,,321

This updates a previous report on mortality only up to the end of 1983. Ninety-nine per cent of the workers were traced satisfactorily. Cancer mortality was 4% less than that of England and Wales [standardised mortality ratio (SMR) = 96; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 90,103] and the same as that of Cumbria (SMR = 100: Cl = 94,107).

Previous findings of such associations with multiple myeloma and bladder cancer were less strong.

For cancers other than leukaemia, the dose-response risk estimates were below those of the adult atomic bomb survivors, but the 90% confidence interval included risks of zero and of 2-3 times higher. For leukaemia (12 deaths, excluding CLL), under an excess relative risk model, the risk estimate derived for the Sellafield workers was about four times higher than that for the adult atomic bomb survivors with a confidence interval ranging from a half to nearly 20 times that of the atomic bomb survivors.

All of these lesions were successfully reproduced in animal experiment, and it was shown that asbestos neoplasm may occur with or without accompanying asbestosis. Incidence of tumors from crocidolite was nearly three times as high as from chrysotile or amosite. It is possible that different carcinogenic entities are responsible for the causation of lung tumors and mesothelial tumors. Lung tumors seem to depend on the adsorptive capacity of asbestos fibers, allowing other carcinogens (heavy metals, polycyclic hydrocarbons, cigarette smoke) to attain a critical focal concentration. Mesothelial tumors, on the other hand, might arise in response to mechanical irritation by fibers which may become lodged during lymphatic spread.

A comparison between atomic bomb survivors and uranium miners,279-285,60,4,"Excess lung cancer risk has been associated with exposure to alpha particle radiation from inhaled radon daughter products among uranium miners in Czechoslovakia, Canada, the United States, and elsewhere, and with exposure to gamma rays and neutrons from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan. Differences in distribution by histological type, as well as certain epidemiological differences, suggest the possibility of differences in the causation of radiation-induced lung cancer. An epidemiological analysis is summarised of results from a blind pathology panel review of tissue slides from lung cancer cases diagnosed in 108 Japanese A bomb survivors and 92 American uranium miners selected on the basis of radiation exposure, smoking history, sex, age, and source and quality of pathology material. Consensus diagnoses were obtained with respect to principal sub-type, including squamous cell cancer, small cell cancer, adenocarcinoma, and less frequent sub-types. The results were analysed in terms of population, radiation dose, and smoking history. As expected, the proportion of squamous cell cancer was positively related to smoking history in both populations. The relative frequencies of small cell cancer and adenocarcinoma were very different in the two populations, but this difference was adequately accounted for by differences in radiation dose (more specifically, dose-based relative risk estimates based on published risk coefficients). Data for the two populations conformed to a common pattern, in which radiation-induced cancers appeared more likely to be of the small-cell sub-type, and less likely to be adenocarcinomas. No additional explanation in terms of radiation quality (alpha particles or gamma rays), uniform or local irradiation, inhaled as against external radiation source, or other population differences, appeared to be required. One possible interpretation of the finding is that radiation-related lung carcinogenesis may depend heavily on interactions with inhaled promoter/progressor agents, such as smoke. Thus, even though ionising events from external gamma rays and inhaled radon decay products are very differently distributed within the lung, the spatial distribution, and cell types, of any resulting cancers may be determined largely by the action of other agents deposited within the bronchi.",0144-8420,-1,embase,1237,,,,325

These risk models provided a basis for identifying covariates that may confound or modify the association between fine particle or sulfate air pollution and mortality, and for identifying sensitive population subgroups. The possibility of confounding due to occupational exposures was also investigated. Residence histories were coded for the study subjects and were used to examine temporal patterns of exposure and risk. Our sensitivity analyses showed the mortality risk estimates for fine particle and sulfate air pollution to be highly robust against alternative risk models of the Cox proportional hazards family, including models with additional covariates from the original questionnaires not included in the original published analyses. There was limited evidence of departures from the proportional hazards assumption. Flexible exposure-response models provided some evidence of departures from linearity at both low and high sulfate concentrations. Incorporating information on changes over time in cigarette smoking and body mass index had little effect on the association between fine particles and mortality. There was limited evidence of variation in risk with attained age, gender, smoking status, occupational exposure to dust and fumes, marital status, heart or lung diseases, or lung function. However, air pollution risk did appear to decreasing with increasing educational attainment. Extensive adjustment for occupation using aggregate indices of occupational “dirtiness” and occupational exposure to known lung carcinogens had little impact on the mortality risks associated with particulate air pollution. Our evaluation of population mobility indicated that relatively few subjects moved from their original city of residence.

This timely article raises a number of scientific issues regarding the development of lung cancer in nonsmokers, including what we know about its etiology—specifically, the contribution of occupational factors and how to identify additional risk factors. What are the Risk Factors for Lung Cancer Among Nonsmokers and do They Differ From Those Among Smokers? Although the literature on the etiology of lung cancer among nonsmokers is small compared with that among smokers, it appears that the factors affecting the development of lung cancer in smokers and nonsmokers are quite similar. Overall, approximately 25% of the nonsmoking cases can be explained by established risk factors.5 These factors include indoor air pollution,6 outdoor air pollution,7 diet,8 previous lung disease,9 radon in the home,10 environmental tobacco smoke,11 physical inactivity,12 and occupation.4 Host factors such as reported family history13 and genetic polymorphisms14 are also linked to lung cancer among nonsmokers as they are among smokers. Lung cancer rates among nonsmokers provide important information regarding the etiology of this disease. Findings from the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Cohorts indicate that mortality rates for lung cancer among nonsmokers were slightly higher among men than women (17.1 vs 14.7 per 100,000) and appear to have been relatively stable over the last 4 decades.1 This small difference does not suggest any huge disparity in exposure to nontobacco risk factors between men and women. It is roughly in the range that might be due to differences between men and women in occupational exposures that have been linked with lung cancer. The relatively stable rates over time suggest no large changes over the past few decades in the overall level of exposure to environmental risk factors associated with lung cancer. Individual exposures could, of course, change without affecting the overall lung cancer mortality rate if there were a balance between increases and decreases in various risk factors. The similarity in risk factors, other than active smoking, for lung cancer among smokers and nonsmokers suggests that risk factors for lung cancer identified among smokers should be also considered risk factors among nonsmokers. If this assumption is correct, then it would not appear necessary to replicate each finding among smokers with a study among nonsmokers before making recommendations and undertaking preventive actions among nonsmokers. Are Occupational Exposures Important? Zeka et al4 conclude that occupational exposures play a limited role in lung cancer risk in their study of nonsmokers. Although they do not quantify “limited role,” it seems not inconsistent with Axelson's15 attributable risk estimates of 15% to 25% for lung cancer from occupational exposures when smoking individuals are also included. This might be viewed, however, as a more important contribution to lung cancer among nonsmokers when recognizing that only approximately 25% can be explained so far.5 It is important to note that currently no established nontobacco risk factor explains a large percentage of lung cancer cases. How can we Best Identify Lung Cancer Risk Factors Among Nonsmokers? Studies restricted to nonsmokers such as the one by Zeka et al4 are designed to eliminate active smoking as a possible confounder in the evaluation of risk factors for lung cancer. This approach assumes that studies among nonsmokers provide the best evidence that a nontobacco factor causes a tobacco-related disease. This is a view held by many epidemiologists despite the fact that most evidence regarding the role of established nontobacco risk factors for lung cancer comes from studies that include smokers. Although it seems like a good idea to restrict studies to nonsmokers, there are several limitations with this approach. A major appeal of studies among nonsmokers is the belief that this may be the only way to confidently eliminate the possibility of confounding from active smoking. It is not clear, however, that confounding in occupational studies (and we suspect for nonoccupational studies also) by active smoking is a very common event.16 Even if confounding by active smoking is a problem, it would not necessarily be eliminated by studying individuals who reported they were nonsmokers, because self-report of smoking status is subject to error. Studies find that 15% to 20% of self-reported nonsmokers have cotinine evels in body fluids in a range typically associated with active smoking.17–20 This is a fairly sizable level of misclassification of smoking status, and one can imagine that misclassification of historical smoking status would be even worse. In addition, limiting investigations of lung cancer to nonsmokers typically leads to a much reduced sample size and many fewer exposed cases. This is a particular problem for studies of occupational exposures because smoking rates among blue collar workers are higher than in the general population. Therefore, exclusion of smokers limits not only the number of cases in the study, but a disproportionate number of blue collar cases who are most likely to have exposures of interest. This is shown by the relatively small number of cases in any specific occupational exposure category in the fairly large study described by Zeka et al.4 Small numbers limit interpretations and make conclusions difficult. Finally, exclusion of smokers also does not allow evaluation of effect modification or interaction from active smoking as has been shown to occur for asbestos and a few other exposures.21 For example, in one study, the relative risk for lung cancer was 5.17 from asbestos exposure, 10.85 from smoking, and 53.24 from interaction of these factors.21,22 Focusing on either factor independently could seriously underestimate the overall impact of that factor on lung cancer development. Presentation of analyses focused exclusively on smokers or nonsmokers can often be useful, but inclusion of results on both smokers and nonsmokers in the same paper might provide the most information regarding nontobacco causes of lung cancer. Conclusions Lung cancer among nonsmokers is a moderately common disease, but established risk factors can only explain approximately 25% of its occurrence. Risk factors among nonsmokers appear to be similar to those among smokers, although interaction with smoking also occurs. Studies that include smokers and nonsmokers would seem to offer the best opportunity to identify additional causes of lung cancer among nonsmokers and to further identify tobacco and other risk factor interactions.",1044-3983 1531-5487,-1,openalex,1575,,,,337

Nationwide exposure to each of the mentioned carcinogens was estimated using workforce data from the Iranian population census of 1995, available from the International Labor Organization (ILO) website. The prevalence of exposure to carcinogens in each industry was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX (CARcinogen EXposure) database, an international occupational carcinogen information system kept and maintained by the European Union. The magnitude of the relative risk of lung cancer for each carcinogen was estimated from local and international literature. Using the Levin modified population attributable risk (incidence) fraction, lung cancer incidence (as estimated by the Tehran Population-Based Cancer Registry) attributable to workplace exposure to carcinogens was estimated. The total workforce in Iran according to the 1995 census identified 12,488,020 men and 677,469 women. Agriculture is the largest sector with 25% of the male and 0.27% of female workforce. After applying the CAREX exposure estimate to each sector, the proportion exposed to lung carcinogens was 0.08% for male workers and 0.02% for female workers. Estimating a relative risk of 1.9 (95% CI of 1.7-2.1) for high exposure and 1.3 (95% CI 1.2-1.4) for low exposure, and employing the Levin modified formula, the fraction of lung cancer attributed to carcinogens in the workplace was 1.5% (95% CI of 1.2-1.9) for females and 12% (95% CI of 10-15) for males. These fractions correspond to an estimated incidence of 1.3 and 0.08 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 population for males and females, respectively.

The overall aim of this project is to estimate the current burden of cancer in Great Britain attributable to occupational factors, and identify carcinogenic agents, industries and occupations for targeting risk prevention. Methods: Attributable fractions and numbers were estimated for mortality and incidence for bladder, lung, non-melanoma skin, and sinonasal cancers, leukaemia and mesothelioma for agents and occupations classified as International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Group 1 and 2A carcinogens with “strong” or “suggestive” evidence for carcinogenicity at the specific cancer site in humans. Risk estimates were obtained from published literature and national data sources used for estimating proportions exposed. Results: In 2004, 78 237 men and 71 666 women died from cancer in Great Britain. Of these, 7317 (4.9%) deaths (men: 6259 (8%); women: 1058 (1.5%)) were estimated to be attributable to work-related carcinogens for the six cancers assessed. Incidence estimates were 13 338 (4.0%) registrations (men: 11 284 (6.7%); women 2054 (1.2%)). Asbestos contributed over half the occupational attributable deaths, followed by silica, diesel engine exhaust, radon, work as a painter, mineral oils in metal workers and in the printing industry, environmental tobacco smoke (non-smokers), work as a welder and dioxins. Occupational exposure to solar radiation, mineral oils and coal tars/pitches contributed 2557, 1867 and 550 skin cancer registrations, respectively. Industries/occupations with large numbers of deaths and/or registrations include construction, metal working, personal and household services, mining (not metals), land transport and services allied to transport, roofing, road repair/construction, printing, farming, the Armed Forces, some other service industry sectors and manufacture of transport equipment, fabricated metal products, machinery, non-ferrous metals and metal products, and chemicals. Conclusions: Estimates for all but leukaemia are greater than those currently used in UK health and safety strategy planning and contrast with small numbers (200–240 annually) from occupational accidents. Sources of uncertainty in the estimates arise principally from approximate data and methodological issues. On balance, the estimates are likely to be a conservative estimate of the true risk. Long latency means that past high exposures will continue to give substantial numbers in the near future.

Asbestos consumption in 1994 ranged, per capita, between 0. 004 kg in northern Europe and 2.4 kg in the former Soviet Union. Population surveys from northern Europe indicate that 15 to 30% of the male (and a few percent of the female) population has ever had occupational exposure to asbestos, mainly in construction (75% in Finland) or in shipyards.

Quantitative risk estimates for lung cancer are derived from analyses of epidemiologic data. A modified excess relative risk model of lung cancer mortality of worker exposure to Rn progeny in underground miners is developed. This models the excess risk per WLM (working level month) in terms of time intervals prior to an attained age, and is dependent on time since exposure and age at risk. Risk projections for the general public in indoor domestic environments are presented and cover exposure situations of current public health concern. For example, lifetime exposure to 1 WLM y-1 is estimated to increase the number of deaths due to lung cancer by a factor of about 1.5 over the current rate for both males and females in a population having the current prevalence of cigarette smoking. Occupational exposure to 4 WLM y-1 from ages 20 to 40 y is projected to increase lung cancer deaths in the general population by a factor of 1.6 over the current rate of this age cohort. In all of these cases, most of the increased risk occurs to smokers for whom the risk is up to 10 times greater than for nonsmokers. Discussion includes the extrapolation of estimates of lung cancer mortality risks from the underground miner data to the general population exposed to Rn and its decay products in the indoor domestic environment.",0017-9078,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1465, 1260, 1573",,,,346

Individual likelihoods were maximized for the two-stage clonal expansion (TSCE) model of carcinogenesis and for an empirical risk model. Possible detrimental and protective bystander effects on mutation and malignant transformation rates were taken into account in the TSCE model. Criteria for non-nested models were used to evaluate the quality of fit. Data were found to be incompatible with the model including a detrimental bystander effect. The model with a protective bystander effect did not improve the quality of fit over models without a bystander effect. The preferred TSCE model was sub-multiplicative in the risks due to smoking and internal radiation, and more than additive. Smoking contributed 57% to the lung cancer deaths, the interaction of smoking and radiation 27%, radiation 10%, and others cause 6%. An assessment of the relative biological effectiveness of plutonium was consistent with the ICRP recommended value of 20.

In contrast to the atomic bomb survivors, a significant elevated lung cancer risk was also found for age attained younger than 55 years.

Banks are characterised by an elevated number of underground floors and spaces, (strong-rooms, strong-box and safe-deposit rooms). The potential risk to bank workers is assessed in the present study combining occupational and residential radon exposure. Methods: Radon concentration was measured with Cr-39 dosimeters at annual and quarterly intervals in ground and underground floors of 134 bank buildings distributed among 7 regions in the North, Centre and South of Italy. Regional mean concentrations obtained in the National Residential Survey conducted by the National Institute of Health were considered as reference for residential exposure. The annual cumulative time typically spent by bank workers in underground and ground levels was estimated to be 120 hrs and 1880 hrs, respectively. The calculated cumulative annual occupational doses were compared to the corresponding residential area values. Lung cancer lifetime risk was then evaluated with a risk model (based on WHO standardization) involving a population life expectancy of 70 years, a lifetime working period between 18 and 65 years of age and a total of 2,000 working hours per year. Results: Without considering occupational exposure, maximum and minimum values of average lifetime risk were reached in the regions with respectively maximum and minimum average residential concentrations (119 and 35 Bq/m3 corresponding respectively to a lifetime risk of 14.7 · 10-3 and 4.4 · 10-3). The relative contribution of occupational exposure to overall lifetime risk was found to be proportionally high in regions with low residential concentrations, while occupational exposure may determine even a decreased overall lifetime risk in the areas with high residential concentrations. Significant absolute lifetime risk increase due to occupational exposure was only observed when very high concentrations were present at the underground levels (peak level = 2,564 Bq/m3). Consequently, organisational and technical interventions were adopted to reduce the maximum level to 500 Bq/m3, as prescribed by Italian legislation. Conclusions: The study confirmed that key determinants of occupational radon exposure for bank workers are represented by radon concentration in the premises and the work time spent in underground floors. The relative contribution of occupational exposure to individual lifetime cancer risk is also strictly dependent on the residential concentrations present in the area where the building is located.",1044-3983 1531-5487,-1,openalex,1739,,,,348

The aim of this study was to estimate the fraction of lung cancer incidence attributed to occupational exposures to Silica, Cadmium, Nickel, Arsenic, Chromium, Diesel Fumes, Beryllium, and Asbestos (the best established lung cancer carcinogens in the workplace). Exposure to each of the mentioned carcinogens at national level was estimated using workforce data estimated by the population census 1995 and obtained from the ILO. The prevalence of exposure for each industry/ carcinogens was estimated using exposure data from the CAREX database (CAREX is an international information system on occupational exposure to known and suspected carcinogens kept and maintained by EU). The magnitude of relative risk of lung cancer for each carcinogen of interest was estimated from local and international literatures. The Levin modified population attributable risk (incidence) fraction was utilized to estimate the fraction of lung cancer incidence as estimated by the Tehran Population Based Cancer Registry that could be attributed to workplace exposure of carcinogens of interest. The crude incidence of lung cancer was 10.4 and 5 per 100.000 populations of male and female, respectively. Total workforce according to the 1995 census was 13165489 of which 12488020 were male and 677469 were female. Agricultural sectors with 25% hold the most frequent number of workforce and electrical related sector with 0.01% hold the least frequent number of workforce. After applying the CAREX exposure estimate to each sector, the proportion of male workers exposed to lung carcinogen was 0.08 and this figure was 0.02 for females. Estimating a relative risk of 1.9 for high exposure and 1.5 for low exposure and employing The Levin modified formula, the fraction of lung cancer attributed to carcinogens in the workplace among female was 0.015 with a 95% CI of (0.012 to 0.019) and this figures were 0.12 with 95%CI of (0.10 to 0.15) for male.

Although the vast majority of mesothelioma cases are caused by asbestos exposure, the number of asbestos-related lung cancers is less clear. This number cannot be determined directly as lung cancer causes are not clinically distinguishable but may be estimated using varying modelling methods. We applied three different modelling methods to the Dutch population supplemented with uncertainty ranges (UR) due to uncertainty in model input values. The first method estimated asbestos-related lung cancer cases directly from observed and predicted mesothelioma cases in an age-period-cohort analysis. The second method used evidence on the fraction of lung cancer cases attributable (population attributable risk (PAR)) to asbestos exposure. The third method incorporated risk estimates and population exposure estimates to perform a life table analysis. The three methods varied substantially in incorporated evidence. Moreover, the estimated number of asbestos-related lung cancer cases in the Netherlands between 2011 and 2030 depended crucially on the actual method applied, as the mesothelioma method predicts 17 500 expected cases (UR 7000-57 000), the PAR method predicts 12 150 cases (UR 6700-19 000), and the life table analysis predicts 6800 cases (UR 6800-33 850).

It is also potentially useful for risk assessment as it allows estimation of cumulative risk under hypothetical exposure interventions. We applied the g-formula in a reanalysis of the Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS), assessing diesel exposure and lung cancer mortality risk. Methods: We applied the parametric g-formula in the DEMS sub-cohort of non-metal miners working underground (n=8,307), to assess effects of interventions on diesel exposure, measured as respirable elemental carbon (REC) on lifetime risk of lung cancer, adjusting for time-varying employment status. The risks of lung cancer under a sequence of occupational exposure limits were compared to what was actually observed. We also estimated the attributable fraction of lung cancer deaths due to observed REC exposure in this population. Results: Lung cancer risk decreased as exposure limits became more stringent. The Risk Ratio (RR) was 0.79 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.47 – 1.13) comparing a hypothetical exposure limit of 25 µg/m3 REC to what actually happened. The RR comparing risk under no exposure to what actually happened was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.41 – 1.09); based on estimated counterfactual cumulative risks, the fraction of lung cancer deaths attributable to REC was 27% in this population. Conclusion: The g-formula controlled for time-varying confounding by employment status, which was affected by diesel exposure and thus would not have been appropriately controlled for in a conventional regression analysis. The parametric g-formula also offers an alternative approach to risk assessment for estimating excess cumulative risk and attributable fractions based entirely on an observed population.",1078-0475 2169-2181,abstract_added,openalex,1710,,,,354

Mineral fiber analysis can provide valuable information for the research of asbestos-associated diseases and for the assessment of exposure. Because of the variability of asbestos exposure and long latency periods, the analysis of asbestos lung content is a relevant method for identification of asbestos-associated diseases. Also, sources of secondary exposure, so called ""bystander exposition"" or environmental exposure can be examined by mineral fiber analysis.Household contacts to asbestos are known for ten patients (1987-2009) in the German mesothelioma register; these patients lived together with family members working in the asbestos manufacturing industry.Analysis of lung tissue for asbestos burden offers information on the past exposure.

Latency times (mean 42.5 years) and mean age at the time of diagnose in patients with mesothelioma are increasing (65.5 years). The decrease of median asbestos burden of the lung in mesothelioma patients results in disease manifestation at a higher age.Lung dust analyses are a relevant method for the determination of causation in mesothelioma.

Numbers of attributable cancers were calculated by applying AFs to 2011 Canadian Cancer Registry data. Historical exposure was derived from CAREX Canada estimates of prevalence and level of exposure. PrE was estimated from the Canadian census, labour force survey and survival probabilities. Analyses focused on 12 carcinogens with ≥5000 exposed women.

Potential confounding by birth cohort and smoking prevalence were also assessed. Lifetime cumulative exposure and highest monthly exposure were the dose metrics evaluated. The estimated lifetime additional risk of lung cancer mortality associated with 45 years of occupational exposure to 1 microg/m3 Cr(VI) (occupational exposure unit risk) was 0.00205 (90%CI: 0.00134, 0.00291) for the relative risk model and 0.00216 (90%CI: 0.00143, 0.00302) for the additive risk model assuming a linear dose response for cumulative exposure with a five-year lag.

In this paper we fit the model of the bystander effect proposed by Brenner and Sachs to 11 cohorts of underground miners, taking account of the covariance structure of the data and the period of latency between the development of the first pre-malignant cell and clinically overt cancer. We also fitted a simple linear relative risk model, with adjustment for age at exposure and attained age. The methods that we use for fitting both models are different from those used by Brenner and Sachs, in particular taking account of the covariance structure, which they did not, and omitting certain unjustifiable adjustments to the miner data. The fit of the original model of Brenner and Sachs (with 0 y period of latency) is generally poor, although it is much improved by assuming a 5 or 6 y period of latency from the first appearance of a pre-malignant cell to cancer. The fit of this latter model is equivalent to that of a linear relative risk model with adjustment for age at exposure and attained age.

The first was a population-based case-control study involving 849 subjects (566 males and 283 females). The second study was based on the data made available by the Third National Census survey, in which the standardized mortality rate (SMR) and population attributable risk (PAR) for lung cancer due to occupational exposure for the population in Guangzhou were analyzed. Results of these two studies show that: in females, indoor air pollution, derived primarily from burning coal, was found to be a highly significant risk factor for lung cancer. In males, however, cigarette smoking and occupational exposure were significantly associated with lung cancer. To further elucidate the contribution of indoor air pollution as a risk factor for lung cancer in nonsmoking females, two additional case-control studies were performed in 1985 and 1986. The 1985 study involved 120 nonsmokers (28 males, 92 females) in which the influence of such lifestyle factors as: personal history of nonmalignant respiratory diseases, fresh vegetable consumption, lifetime occupation and occupational exposure histories, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS), degree of indoor air pollution, general conditions of home residence, cooking practices and environments, and family history of cancer were first individually assessed and then collectively subjected to multiple conditional regression analysis for evaluation as risk factors for lung cancer. The 1986 study involved 75 cases of never-smoking females in which the aim was to investigate the influence of exposure to spousal smoke as a risk factor for lung cancer. These studies suggest that consumption of fresh vegetables was a ""protective"" factor for lung cancer in both males and females. In females, indoor air pollution and size of the kitchen were risk factors for lung cancer, whereas ETS exposure, respiratory disease history, family history of cancer, living conditions, use of cooking fuel, and participation in cooking, were not statistically associated with female lung cancer deaths. Occupational exposure was also correlated with the incidence of female lung cancer deaths. In males, chemists had the highest SMR, whereas in females, homemakers had the highest SMR. In males, the most common lung cancer cell type was squamous cell carcinoma, whereas in females adenocarcinoma was the most predominant type. The factors affecting the distribution of histologic lung cancer cell types were also investigated and discussed.",0169-5002,title_duplicate,"pubmed, embase","1432, 1225",,,,363

Few, if any of these studies, are adequately adjusted for both relatively simple measures of cigarette smoking or the potentially more subtle effects of the duration of smoking. Because urbanization and industrial sources of air pollution correspond chronologically with the major increases in cigarette smoking, it is not likely that the specific attributable risk to each component can be adequately assessed. Interactions between cigarette smoking and specific air pollutants, similar to those seen between cigarette smoking and asbestos and or radiation, may be occurring. Considering the various estimates made over the last 25 years, it is likely that the effect of air pollution on lung cancer is something greater than zero; however, it is unlikely that the estimate exceeds 2% of all lung cancers or 5/100,000 cases in urban males.

However, the age structure of an exposed group has an impact on these estimates, because disease rates vary by age and the exposed population may be younger than the national population in the estimation year. Method To account for this, PAFs can be calculated by age, and applied separately by age to national incidence data. We have adapted our risk period methodology, which takes account of latency to estimate numbers exposed to a causative agent using Levin’s formula for PAF, to estimate a workforce turnover factor by age group, which accounts for the age structure of an exposed population. To estimate age-specific RRs from unit relative risks per year of exposure, the link between age and duration of exposure can be modelled using Monte-Carlo methods. Results We show the effect of estimating the burden of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to respirable crystalline silica for Britain using PAF estimates which do or do not take age into account. Taking account of age and assuming recruitment between ages 15–44, there were 1188 lung cancer registrations in males in 2010, or 798 without accounting for age, or 636 vs. 804 assuming recruitment between ages 15–24. The extension to using age-specific RRs is demonstrated for occupational asbestos-related lung cancers. Conclusions< Given the above results, and although highly dependent on assumptions made about workforce ages, there is clearly a case to be made to estimate PAFs by age.",1351-0711 1470-7926,-1,openalex,1662,,,,365

Hajok et al. [1], the main objective of which was “to estimate the risks of the morbidity of the asbestos-related lung cancer in the general population of Poles as the result of increased exposure to asbestos fibers which occurs during the removal and disposal of asbestos-cement products in Poland.”Contrary to mesothelioma, considered to be a neoplasm specific to environmental exposure to asbestos [2–6], the risk of lung cancer is rarely a subject of analysis in the context of environmental exposure of residents. It is, among others, due to having no features of neoplasm that enable the indication of asbestos as a causative factor, as well as numerous competitive factors of the incidence of this neoplasm. According to the recommendations of the experts of WHO, in the case of this kind of neoplasm, the only practical approach is to use the population attributable fraction (PAF) [7, 8]. Therefore, the published article is even more noteworthy; its contents raise a number of questions and doubts concerning both substantive bases and methodological approach to the analysis.Firstly, the statement “increased exposure to asbestos fibers which occurs during the removal and disposal of asbestos-cement products in Poland” does not find its confirmation in the published papers. The size of asbestos fibers concentrations during removal of asbestos-cement products was in Poland a subject of numerous measurements taken on various work posts as well as in the atmospheric air. The published results do not confirm the thesis concerning both high concentrations of asbestos fibers during products dismantling as well as, related to these works, a considerable increase in the concentration of asbestos fibers in the atmospheric air, provided safe and legally regulated methods of work are applied [9–13].Secondly, description of the method is limited to a very vague statement: “Taking into consideration the concentration of asbestos fibers in the air of particular administrative area and the number and type of former plants producing asbestos-cement products, as well as standardized incidence rates (SIR) of asbestos-dependent diseases (…) three zones of the country with varying degrees of risk of asbestos-related disease were isolated.” In order to make it possible for the readers to get familiar with the method applied, a reference number [14] was indicated. However, in that paper we do not find answers to any of the elementary questions, inter alia, what does “type of former plants producing asbestos-cement products” mean and how was it determined; there is also no description of the method for calculating standardized incidence rates (SIR) of asbestos-related diseases, which turned out to be cases of occupational diseases diagnosed in Poland. Occupational asbestos-related diseases reported in Poland over the years 2001–2009, which the authors used to determine the 3 zones of environmental exposure to asbestos, are a result of exposure in the 70s and 80s of the previous century. During that period concentrations on the work posts ranged from 2 to 8 f/cm3, that is, from 2.000.000 to 8.000.000 f/m3 of air [15], whereas mean concentrations in the atmospheric air estimated in all provinces of Poland based on the total of 5962 samples for 1634 sampling sites amounted to about 500 f/m3 of air, exceeding 1000 f/m3 [13] only in few points.Thirdly, based on the description of the method one should presume that in the extrapolation of the incidence of occupational asbestos-related lung cancer (from the area of high doses) in the case of the risk of incidence of lung cancer caused by environmental exposure in the general population (to the area of low doses) occurrence of the same risk was assumed and no coefficient reflecting the size of exposure was applied.It seems reasonable then to ask what are the substantive grounds for using “incidence ratio” of occupational asbestos-related diseases for the purpose of forecasting the number of lung cancer cases caused by environmental exposure related to dismantling of asbestos-cement products? It should be emphasized that, among individuals who are exposed paraoccupationally and environmentally, the literature has not reported any cases of asbestosis, which constitutes about 60–70% of the total number of cases of occupational diseases induced by asbestos [15, 16].In conclusion, if presented in the article estimation of the risk of incidence of lung cancer associated with exposure to asbestos dust during removal, securing, and dismantling of products, mainly asbestos-cement ones, in the general population of Poland was reliable, the works would contribute to the incidence of 14 thousand new cases of lung cancer. In such a situation the only conclusion is to call for the immediate cessation of the “Programme for Asbestos Abatement in Poland 2009–2032.”",1537-744X 2356-6140,-1,openalex,1659,,,,368

The number of lung carcinogens considered by the different studies ranged from 8 in the GBD to 21 in the CBD and UKBD. More well-established carcinogens such as silica, which are driven by similar patterns of exposure (especially in construction) across countries, have more consistent estimates (2.4% in both the CBD and UKBD). Others such as asbestos have significant challenges in historical exposure assessment, as well as differences in exposure context between countries, leading to variability between estimates (5.9%–8.0%). Differing methods and assumptions regarding radon also led to variable estimates (0.6%–1.3%). Relatively recent epidemiologic evidence for diesel exhaust and lung cancer incorporated into the Canadian estimates led to higher AFs than previous estimates. Changing evidence, differences in context, and variability in methods mean that burden estimates are not strictly comparable across projects, and continuing to assess the burden for different countries remains relevant.",,-1,openalex,1642,,,,369

Although the effects of cigarette smoking on cancer risk have been well documented, there remain several outstanding issues to be clarified, including the determination of which types of cancer are associated with smoking and estimation of the magnitude of the effect of smoking on different types of cancer. A further issue is whether the effects seen elsewhere can be demonstrated in Canada, where tobacco products differ somewhat from those In other countries. Methods. A case-control study was undertaken in Montreal to investigate the associations between a large number of environmental and occupational exposures on the one hand, and several types of cancer on the other. Between 1979 and 1985, interviews were carried out with incident male cases of 21 types of cancer, including 15 anatomical sites and six histological subtypes. The interview was designed to obtain detailed information on smoking histories, job histories, and other potential confounders. Altogether, 3730 cancer patients and 533 population controls were interviewed. For each type of cancer analysed, two control groups were used: population controls and cancer controls (selected from among other cancer patients). The purpose of the present analysis is to estimate the relative risk of each of 21 types of cancer in relation to smoking and to estimate the percentage of cancer cases attributable to cigarette smoking. Results. Separate analyses conducted with the two control groups produced similar results. Of the many sites of cancer examined, the following were not associated with cigarette smoking: colon, rectum, liver, prostate, kidney and skin (melanoma). Within the lymphoreticular system, there was no excess risk of Hodgkin's lymphoma, although the results for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were weakly suggestive of an association with smoking. The following sites were clearly associated with smoking: lung (odds ratio [OR]=12.1), bladder (OR=2.4), oesophagus (OR=2.4), stomach (OR=1.7), and pancreas (OR=1.6). Population attributable risk percentages due to smoking were 90% for lung, 53% for bladder, 54% for oesophagus, 35% for stomach, and 33% for pancreas. Conclusions. Of the 21 types of cancer examined, the following were associated with smoking among men in Montreal: lung (including all major histological subtypes), bladder (and its main histological subtypes), oesophagus, stomach and pancreas.

This is a fascinating social observation, but to what ends this so-called freedom? Smoking has provided for women the dubious distinction of sharing with men the tragic effects of pulmonary emphysema, chronic bronchitis, carcinoma of the lung, and a host of other “blessings” derived from tobacco. Cancer of the lung is now responsible for 6 percent of deaths in women caused by malignancies. This incidence is exceeded only by cancer of the breast, gastrointestinal tract, and uterus. This phenomenally increased rate of lung cancer among women of all ages is directly related to their smoking habits, since the risk of cancer increases in accordance with the number of cigarettes consumed and the duration of smoking. In addition to the lungs, women, like men, have other target organs affected by smoking. Perhaps three-fourths of myocardial infarctions among women under the age of 45 could be prevented if they did not smoke. Furthermore, there are smoking hazards that are unique to women. Cigarette smoking substantially increases the danger of a heart attack or a cerebrovascular accident in those who are using birth control pills. Women who are “on the pill” and who smoke are three times more likely to die of a heart attack or circulatory disease than those who take the pill but do not smoke. Cigarette smoking is also associated with higher rates of fetal mortality. Recent data indicate that more than 30,000 babies are born in the United States every year with significantly lower birth weights because their mothers smoked during pregnancy. Diseases such as lung cancer and atherosclerosis are multi-factorial afflictions. Smoking is a risk factor of enormous importance in these pulmonary and cardiovascular pathologic states. Occupational lung diseases, in particular, represent a dramatic example of interaction of multiple risk factors and cigarette smoking. The risks of pulmonary malignancy in workers in asbestos plants and several other industries become greatly increased in those who insist upon smoking in spite of the potential hazard of their occupational exposures. Since smoking was once regarded as a status symbol of equality, some psychiatrists contend that it may be more difficult for women than for men to stop smoking. Unfortunately, some women still equate smoking with the achievement of social freedom. Surely such a concept is intrinsically erroneous when one views the consequences. Therefore, any cigarette advertising campaign which preys upon womens' desire for equality is either cynical or naive. The facts are irrefutable and it is wishful thinking to assert (as a government official recently did) that a relatively safe cigarette exists. How do commercial interests react when scientific facts accumulate in a torrent of evidence that cigarettes are exceedingly dangerous? They go on the offensive, of course! A representative of the R. G. Reynolds Company recently described the beginnings of a new campaign that is called “pride in tobacco.” The symbol of this pride will appear on bumper stickers, lapel pins, baseball caps, posters, commemorative stamps, newspaper ads and highway billboards. One can be certain that this new campaign will be well financed since the cigarette industry is spending more than $442,000,-000 annually for advertising. Indeed, industry spends more in advertising in one day than the Federal government's principal agency concerned with smoking problems spends for all of its operations in one year. A survey completed a few years ago revealed that approximately 53,000,000 people in America smoke and that nearly half of this group were women; 72 percent of these women were between 15 and 24 years of age. The enticing slogans of the purveyors of nicotine appear to be accomplishing their commercial goals. False hopes, false slogans, false freedoms. Cigarettes continue to maim and to kill, but we are assured that proof of causation is absent. Teenage girls in large numbers are beginning to form this habit and are complimented by being told that they've come a long way. Indeed they have. Women of all ages have come a long way toward equaling the appalling morbidity and mortality rates of men smokers. You've regressed a long way, baby.",0012-3692 1931-3543,-1,openalex,1764,,,,373

29,1591,Lars Hagmar,2001,Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health,10.5271/sjweh.580,How confident can we be that acrylonitrile is not a human carcinogen?,1-3,27,1,"Acrylonitrile is an important industrial chemical used in large quantities for, for example, the production of acrylic fibers (1). More than 100 000 workers in the United States and Europe are potentially exposed. Whether occupational exposure to acrylonitrile causes increased risk for cancer in humans has been under debate for a long time. The proceedings from a workshop on this matter were recently published as a supplement to the Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health (2). The reason for the debate has been the apparent contradiction between experimental animal data and epidemiologic results. Two papers in this issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Work Environment & Health add interesting information to this discussion (3, 4). Animal experiments clearly show that acrylonitrile is carcinogenic (1). A high incidence of astrocytomas in the brain and spinal cord was the most consistent finding. In a 2-year inhalation study (6 hours/day, 5 days/week) on rats, the lowest dose associated with an increased incidence of astrocytomas was 20 ppm (5). Acrylonitrile can readily be taken up in the body by inhalation and metabolized to a reactive epoxide, cyanoethylene oxide, mainly by the cytochrome P450 isozyme CYP2E1 (6). Cyanoethylene oxide, which is thought to play an important role in the carcinogenic properties of acrylonitrile, is detoxified by glutathione conjugation in rodents, whereas in humans detoxification via epoxide hydrolase plays an important role. Hemoglobin adducts of acrylonitrile can be used as toxicologically relevant biomarkers of exposure (7). Acrylonitrile has been the subject of a large number of epidemiologic studies of workers. Three large cohort studies provided exposure estimates for acrylonitrile (8-10). Current operations in the production of acrylonitrile have exposure levels of &le;0.5 ppm for an 8-hour time-weighted average, whereas past exposures have sometimes exceeded 20 ppm (11). A meta-analysis of 25 studies of acrylonitrile workers indicated essentially null findings for lung, brain, and prostate cancer. In the cohort study by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Poisson regression analyses showed, however, an excess of lung cancer (relative risk 1.5) in the highest quintile of cumulative exposure for acrylonitrile (8). In this issue Marsh et al (3) present a reanalysis of the NCI-NIOSH cohort, for which standardized mortality ratios (SMR) are calculated for workers exposed and unexposed to acrylonitrile using national and regional comparison rates for the general population in the United States. The SMR value for lung cancer in the quintile of the most highly exposed workers was only 0.9. With the use of external rates, the lower risk estimate was due to a significant 30% deficit in lung cancer deaths for the unexposed workers. No plausible reason for this deficit is proposed. The authors of the original publication were very cautious in their interpretation of the data: "" . . . analyses of exposure-response do not provide strong or consistent evidence for a causal association [p 25]"" (8). The result of the reanalysis supports their cautiousness. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has recently changed its evaluation of acrylonitrile from probably (2A) to possibly (2B) carcinogenic, due to the fact that there is inadequate evidence for carcinogenicity in humans, despite sufficient evidence with respect to experimental animals (1). According to the paper by Schulz et al in this issue, the cancer potency of acrylonitrile in the central nervous system (CNS), estimated from the best available animal inhalation study, is not inconsistent with observed deaths in the epidemiologic studies (4). This result differs from that of earlier animal-based risk models, from which larger human risks were derived (12-13). The model used by Schulz et al differs in several important aspects from the previous ones. First, adjustment for less-than-lifetime follow-up was more realistic because it took into account increasing CNS cancer rates with age. Second, the exposure assessments developed specifically for each cohort were applied in the model. Third, the CNS cancer potency factor derived from a rat inhalation study (5) was 18 times smaller than the potency factor derived from an ingestion bioassay used for earlier models. The conversion of acrylonitrile potency from animals to humans depends on the exposure metric chosen. Schulz et al (4) used preferably average continuous lifetime exposure rather than lifetime cumulative exposure, the result being lower human risk estimates. Altogether 24 incident cases of CNS cancer deaths were observed in the 3 cohorts with exposure data as compared with 25.9 expected (4), which corresponds to an SMR of 0.93 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.60-1.40]. The prediction derived from the bioassay-based model by Schulz et al (4) was 28.9 deaths, which corresponds to an SMR of 1.11 (95% CI 0.76-1.62). The authors conclude that ""The CNS cancer potencies estimated from the best available inhalation bioassay was consistent with the observed deaths in the epidemiologic studies . . . [p 14]"" (4). This is a reasonable conclusion, but it should be added that a lack of association cannot be excluded either. It is extremely difficult to verify or falsify low risk increases for rare diseases in occupational cohort studies. The observed number of deaths from CNS cancer in the 3 cohort studies has to increase more than 10-fold before the lower 95% CI limit for an SMR of 1.11 exceeds unity. Therefore, it is not realistic that an excess risk for CNS cancer deaths due to occupational acrylonitrile exposure, predicted from the rat inhalation bioassay-model, can ever be evaluated against empirical data from epidemiologic studies. One limitation of the bioassay model for risk estimation used by Schulz et al (4) is that, for both rats and humans, it is based on airborne exposure levels, and not on biologically effective biomarkers of dose, such as hemoglobin adducts. Adduct studies are also needed to clarify whether genetic polymorphisms for CYP2E1 or epoxide hydrolase modifies the formation and detoxification of cyanoethylene oxide in acrylonitrile-exposed humans. In conclusion it can be said that results from epidemiology and the bioassay model make it obvious that the excess risk for the acrylonitrile-exposed workers cannot have been large. Decision making and the regulation of exposure to acrylonitrile not only has to rely on cancer epidemiology data, but also on other considerations.",0355-3140 1795-990X,-1,openalex,1591,,,,375

Self-reported questionnaires were used to elicit a lifetime occupational history, including general tasks, and information for other risk factors. Occupational hygienists, who were blinded to case-control status, assigned asbestos exposures to each job on the basis of (i) concentration (low, medium, high), (ii) frequency (<5%, 5-30%, and >30% of the time in a normal work week), and (iii) reliability (possible, probable, definite). Logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). Those occupationally exposed to (i) low, and (ii) medium or high concentrations of asbestos had ORs for lung cancer of 1.17 (95% CI=0.92 - 1.50) and 2.16 (95% CI=1.21-3.88), respectively, relative to those who were unexposed. Medium or high exposure to asbestos roughly doubled the risk for lung cancer across all three smoking pack-year categories. The joint relationship between smoking and asbestos was consistent with a multiplicative risk model. Our findings provide further evidence that exposure to asbestos has contributed to an increased risk of lung cancer in Canadian workplaces, and suggests that nearly 3% of lung cancers among Canadian men are caused by occupational exposure to asbestos.",1471-2407,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1348, 1108, 1539",,,,376

Besides the smoking habit, the indoor air pollution from coal combustion may also make some contribution. The purpose of our study is to explore the risk of lung cancer death in male residents who live in coal-using families. Stratified by two extreme levels of ambient sulphur dioxide (SO2) and inhalable particulate (IP) concentrations, 4 areas were chosen in the city proper: Area A (low SO2, low IP); Area B (high SO2, low IP); Area C (low SO2, high IP) and Area D (high SO2, high IP). Within each of these areas, two neighboring residential groups were chosen, one of which uses coal as fuel (group 1), with the other using coal gas or liquified petroleum gas as fuel (group 0). The percentages of smokers and the ambient environment of the two chosen groups within each area are comparable. Total person-years observed is 117,039 from 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1987 for all males in the 8 groups. The mortalities (per 100,000 person years) of male lung cancer in the 8 groups are as follows: A0-22.33, A1-37.64; B0-27.14, B1-30.72; C0-41.77, C1-54.99; D0-49.97, D1-78.11. The result shows that male lung cancer mortality in the coal-using group is higher than that in the coal-gas-using group within each area. Mantel-Haenszel's Relative Risk (RRMH) of male lung cancer in coal-using groups is 1.44 stratified by ambient SO2 and IP and smoking levels.

That results from the fact that epidemiological studies are performed directly on humans so that it is possible to avoid bias very often associated with methods of extrapolation between animals and humans. Moreover, a slow but continuous increase in the number of well designed epidemiological studies with results which can be used to estimate dose-response relationship is being observed. In this paper, the methodological foundations of cancer risk modelling on the basis of epidemiological studies are discussed, and the dose-response relationship based on epidemiological study carried out in an occupational cohort of workers employed in a pulp and paper plant was estimated. The epidemiological study was performed by the team of the Department of Epidemiology, The Nofer Institute of Occupational Medicine, Lódź. Lung cancer was adopted as the effect of occupational exposure. In oder to estimate the increase in cancer risk induced by occupational exposure, the risk for the whole occupational life was calculated by employing the methods of competitive risks, essential relative risks were modelled using Poisson means for data divided into groups, and a Cox proportional-hazards model was used for single data. The analysis indicated, that the data from epidemiological studies render it possible to carry out a more thorough investigation as compared to data obtained from animal experiments. As to the cohort under study, a certain effect of age at which workers enter into exposure on lung cancer risk was observed. A risk 'outfit' the workers bring in at the beginning of their employment is clearly visible in older age groups. A general conclusion drawn from the study may be formulated as follows: epidemiological studies play a major role in assessing the effect of working conditions on the increase in the morbidity risk, however, they are not a panacea for all the problems emerging in the cancer risk assessment in exposed persons. Therefore, information obtained from epidemiological and toxicological studies should supplement and reinforce one another, and data from both sources should be used to obtain the best possible characteristics of risk cancer in humans",,abstract_added,openalex,1732,,,,379

They cited many interesting and current studies that confirm such a point of view that there is negative correlation between lung cancer mortality and radon concentration or even that beneficial effects are observed for a broad range of radon concentrations. We conclude that the Revisers must be strong followers of the hormesis theory. We appreciate the effort they put into their letter. We are followers of the linear no-threshold (LNT) model as well as most of the scientific world so far. As it is well known, the LNT model has been accepted for a long time as the basis for assessing risks from the ionizing radiation. This approach has been repeatedly endorsed by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR), the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP), the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement (NCRP), and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR)[3]. And this approach has not been officially changed yet. We are of course aware that the dose-response model for low doses radiation is uncertain, and it leaves a lot of space for speculation. Even the Bayesian analysis of many studies, that Revisers came to mind in their letter [4],„does not support the conclusion, that below 800 Bq× m–3 lung cancer risk increase,” but it does not support the conclusion that below this radon concentration lung cancer risk decreases, either. Last casecontrol studies of lung cancer and indoor radon neither support any theory in 100% of certainty nor the LNT or hormesis [5, 6].",1896-494X,abstract_added,pubmed,1322,,,,380

In contrast, age-specific lung cancer death rates for those aged under 79 years plateaued recently, reflecting the decreasing smoking rates since 1966. However, the smoking rate for males (54% in 1999) is still extraordinarily high in Japan compared to other developed countries, so it is necessary to further promote anti-smoking activities. It is reported that the relative risk for lung cancer due to cigarette smoking increases 4-5 fold (current smokers versus non-smokers) for males and 2-3 fold for females, and that the population attributable risk is 70% for males and 15-25% for females in Japan, which indicates that cigarette smoking is the most influential risk factor for lung cancer. However, the magnitude of the relative risk and population attributable risk is not as high as those observed in other developed countries. In order to clarify the reasons for this, it is necessary to further accumulate findings from actual epidemiological studies in Japan. In addition to cigarette smoking, occupational exposures, dietary habits (low intake of vegetables and fruits), atmospheric air pollution, environmental tobacco smoke, cooking and heating fuels, indoor radon and previous lung diseases are reported to increase the risk of lung cancer.",,abstract_added,openalex,1726,,,,381

Logistic regression methods were used to derive discrete-time estimates of rate ratios. An indirect approach to control for unmeasured confounding by smoking was employed that involves joint modeling of lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) mortality. Results: Prior to indirect adjustment for smoking, there was minimal evidence of association between lung cancer mortality and cumulative radiation dose under a 10-year lag assumption (RR at 100 mSv = 0.90; 90% CI: 0.80-1.01).

Subjects were asked about ETS exposure from different tobacco products in childhood and in adulthood at home, at the work place and in vehicles. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to assess the effects of the ETS exposure variables on lung cancer. Exposure to ETS during childhood was strongly associated with lung cancer (odds ratio (OR) = 3.9; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.9-8.2), the effect mostly arising from exposure to cigarettes smoke. The excess risk was observed with either a smoking father or mother. An increasing risk was found with increasing number of smokers and duration of exposure.

No increased risk was found with exposure to a smoking spouse, except for those exposed only to cigarette smoke (OR = 5.1; 95% CI = 1.5-17). A weak association was seen between lung cancer and ETS exposure at the workplace, which increased with the number of years of exposure. Exposure in vehicles also was detected as a risk factor for lung cancer in non-smokers.

Advances in methodology include the use of nested dose-response models for the parameters of the two-stage clonal expansion model, calculation of attributable risks for all exposure combinations, use of both a fixed lag and a gamma distribution to represent the time between generation of the first malignant cell and death from lung cancer, and scaling of biological parameters allowed by parameter identifiability. The cohort consists of 12,011 males working for the Yunnan Tin Corporation, with complete exposure records, who were initially surveyed in 1976 and followed through 1988. Tobacco and arsenic dominate the attributable risk for lung cancer. Of 842 lung cancer deaths, 21.4% are attributable to tobacco alone, 19.7% to a combination of tobacco and arsenic, 15.8% to arsenic alone, 11% to a combination of arsenic and radon, 9.2% to a combination of tobacco and radon, 8.7% to combination of arsenic, tobacco and radon, 5.5% to radon alone, and 8.7% to background.

The predominant histological type of lung cancer among miners changed from small-cell undifferentiated for short follow-up time to epidermoid after long follow-up times.

Materials and methods Individual, annualized organ doses were estimated from film badge records (n monitored = 2514), occupational chest x-rays (n = 2514), uranium urinalysis (n = 1868), radium intake through radon breath measurements (n = 487), and radon ambient measurements (n = 1356). Silica dust exposure from pitchblende processing was estimated (n = 1317). Vital status and cause of death determination through 2019 relied upon the National Death Index and Social Security Administration Epidemiological Vital Status Service. The analysis included standardized mortality ratios (SMRs), Cox proportional hazards, and Poisson regression models. Results Vital status was confirmed for 99.4% of workers (84.0% deceased). For a dose weighting factor of 1 for intakes of uranium, radium, and radon decay products, the mean and median lung doses were 65.6 and 29.9 mGy, respectively. SMRs indicated a difference in health outcomes between salaried and hourly workers, and more brain cancer deaths than expected [SMR: 1.79; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14, 2.70].

There was an excess of brain cancers compared with the US population, although no radiation dose-response was detected. The association between radiation and kidney cancer remained, though potentially due to few cases at higher doses. The association between levels of silica dust ≥23.6 mg/m3-year and NMKD also remained. No association was observed between radiation and lung cancer.

Among the asbestos cement workers mortalities were 234.0 x 100,000 person-years among men and 35.5 among women. Corresponding figures in the general (non-occupationally exposed) population in Casale Monferrato were 80.6 and 18.7. The rates in the general population were not higher than in the rest of the region. Attributable risk (AR) among the asbestos cement workers (and wives) is 67.5% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 56.8 to 78.2) for men and 51.3% (95% CI 14.9 to 87.8) among women. Population AR to occupational or paraoccupational exposure in the asbestos cement production is 18.3% (95% CI 11.1 to 25.6) among men and 10.1% (95% CI 0 to 24.6) among women. This work did not show an increase in mortality from lung cancer for the population not exposed occupationally, but a large excess was found among men and women occupationally exposed in asbestos cement production. The total burden of lung cancer due to occupational exposure to asbestos may be underestimated, as only occupational exposure in asbestos cement production was taken into consideration. Nevertheless even a single factory can be responsible for a considerable proportion of deaths from lung cancer in a population.",1351-0711,-1,"pubmed, embase, openalex","1423, 1213, 1556",,,,392

Before our epidemiological studies, petroleum refinery workers were not considered at risk for asbestos-related pathologies, in spite of the documented presence of asbestos. This article reports these studies, which demonstrate a high risk of pleural mesothelioma and point to the occupational origin of some asbestos-related pathologies among the maintenance staff of the refineries. Materials and methods. Cohort and case-control epidemiological studies, conducted in Liguria and Canada, analysed the subgroup most heavily exposed to asbestos (maintenance staff) and the control groups not exposed (office staff and the general population). Relative risk (RR) and attributable risk (AR) have been estimated also using Poisson regression. Results. Our studies on the maintenance staff have indicated a very high AR for pleural mesothelioma (96-100%) and lung cancer (42-49%), and an excess of mortality due to all neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes. Conclusions. The excess of mesothelioma (sentinel event) has permitted the identification of the group exposed to asbestos (the maintenance staff). The internal comparison has allowed the detection of excess asbestos-related pathologies. The presence of an asbestos risk in refineries is now confirmed at an international level, but there is a tendency to limit the effects of asbestos to mesothelioma only. On the contrary, according to our studies, many other neoplastic and non-neoplastic pathologies should be recognized as occupational diseases. In order to highlight such risks, it is however necessary to use methods which are in accordance with good epidemiological practice, such as the identification of both the subgroup of actually exposed workers and the appropriate reference population.",1128-6598,manual_review,embase,1160,,,,393

The extrapolation of lung cancer risk from the higher exposures in the miners to the generally lower exposures in the home is a substantial source of uncertainty in the assessment of the risk of indoor radon. Using the pooled data for the miners, analyses of lung cancer risk were carried out on data restricted to lower exposures, either <50 WLM or <100 WLM. In the pooled data, there were 115 lung cancer cases among workers with no occupational WLM exposure and 2,674 among exposed miners, with 353 and 562 lung cancer cases in miners with <50 WLM and <100 WLM, respectively. Relative risks (RRs) for categories of WLM based on deciles exhibited a statistically significant increasing trend with exposure in each of the restricted data sets. In the restricted data, there was little evidence of departures from a linear excess relative risk model in cumulative exposure, although power to assess alternative exposure-response trends was limited. The general patterns of declining excess RR per WLM with attained age, time since exposure and exposure rate seen in the unrestricted data were similar to the patterns found in the restricted data. Risk models based on the unrestricted data for miners provided an excellent fit to the restricted data, suggesting substantial internal validity in the projection of risk from miners with high exposures to those with low exposures.

Cigarette smoking was found to be the principal cause of lung cancer in this population, accounting for 55% of the lung cancers in males and 37% in females. The attributable risk percentage among females is high compared to elsewhere in China, largely because of a higher prevalence of smoking among women. After adjustment for smoking, there were also significant increases in lung cancer risk associated with several measures of exposure to air pollutants. Risks were twice as high among those who reported smoky outdoor environments, and increased in proportion to years of sleeping on beds heated by coal-burning stoves (kang), and to an overall index of indoor air pollution. Threefold increases in lung cancer risk were found among men who worked in the nonferrous smelting industry, where heavy exposures to inorganic arsenic have been reported. The associations with both smoking and indoor air pollution were stronger for squamous cell and small cell carcinomas than for adenocarcinoma of the lung.

It presents a historical perspective, citing the identification of multiple causes of lung cancer including tobacco smoking and occupational and environmental agents. With this background, the presentation will then turn to critical questions that remain to be addressed and that are currently the focus of extensive research. The origins of the current pandemic of lung cancer lie in the rise of the modern cigarette industry at the start of the last century. The context for this presentation is set by more than half a century of epidemiologic research, carried out to identify the causes of lung cancer as a basis for preventing this highly fatal malignancy. The pandemic was first noted through examination of mortality statistics and by astute clinicians who recognized that they were seeing increasing numbers of lung cancer cases. With regard to smoking and lung cancer, 1950 marks the start of a rising wave of epidemiological research on lung cancer. Even earlier, studies of miners had linked radon exposure to lung cancer, and several case-control studies on smoking and lung cancer were carried out in Nazi Germany. In 1950, the results of five case-control studies associating smoking with lung cancer were published, and by 1954, the “retrospective” findings of the case-control studies were confirmed with the initial findings from Doll and Hill's prospective cohort study of British physicians, the study of US Veterans, and the earliest of the cohort studies carried out by the American Cancer Society. Across the 1950s, findings of additional case-control and cohort studies were reported, leading to syntheses of the evidence in the early 1960s and the conclusion that smoking causes lung cancer. For active smoking and lung cancer, the relationship of risk to the pattern of smoking is well documented: risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked; the duration of smoking; and it declines with increasing duration of time since successful quitting. Smoking greatly increases the overall risk of lung cancer with current estimates showing about a 20-fold higher risk, comparing current smokers to never smokers. Over the four decades since the 1964 Surgeon General's report, epidemiological research on lung cancer has been conducted and findings reported with rising frequency. While cigarette smoking has always remained as a central theme, other causes have been evaluated and substantial research has been directed at other environmental factors and at genetic factors that might modify the risk of smoking. The causal agents identified include secondhand smoke (SHS) and a variety of occupational exposures, and urban air pollution generally. The search for modifying factors, particularly diet, has been less successful. In recent decades, researchers have increasingly addressed genetic determinants of lung cancer risk and much of the ongoing epidemiological research is based in the hybrid approach of “molecular epidemiology,” which joins laboratory and population research methods. Just over two decades after the 1964 Surgeon General's report, passive smoking, a widespread exposure, was found to be a cause of lung cancer. The first major epidemiological studies on passive smoking and lung cancer were reported in 1981 and subsequently more than 50 studies have been reported on exposure to secondhand smoke and lung cancer risk in never smokers. Passive smoking, i.e., inhaling SHS, causes lung cancer in never smokers, a conclusion reached in 1986 by the U.S. Surgeon General and reaffirmed in many subsequent reports, including, most recently, the 2006 Surgeon General's report. This conclusion is supported by epidemiological studies, which show about a 25% increased risk for never smokers married to smokers versus those married to never smokers, and by understanding the nature of tobacco smoke and the mechanisms by which it causes cancer. Other air pollutants also contribute to the causation of lung cancer. Radon, long ago identified as an occupational carcinogen, is also a ubiquitous contaminant in indoor environments; it occurs naturally through the decay of uranium. It enters homes in the soil gas drawn into homes or in water, and in some circumstances, it may be released by building materials. There is a wide range of levels, with some homes having concentrations equivalent to those measured in uranium mines. Biological understanding implies that radon causes lung cancer at any level of exposure and that the exposure-response relationship is linear at typical indoor concentrations. For the United States, indoor radon is estimated to be the second leading cause of lung cancer. Indoor environments may also be contaminated by smoke from biomass fuels and from cooking. Studies in several populations suggest that exposure to smoke indoors may increase lung cancer risk. Outdoor air is also contaminated by combustion-related carcinogens. While the risk has been difficult to quantify, there is a general consensus that urban air pollution contributes to the causation of lung cancer. Occupational agents are also well established causes of lung cancer (Table 1), with associated risks that have been quite high in some worker groups. Evidence indicates that some occupational agents, e.g., radon, may interact synergistically with smoking, and thereby place workers who smoke at particularly high risk. For the population overall, occupational exposures have been estimated to cause a relatively small proportion of cases; estimates range from about 5 to 15% and vary by country and time period. At this time, the list of causal risk factors for lung cancer is lengthy (Table 1) and attributable risk estimates show that the occurrence of most cases of the disease can be explained. In countries where cigarette smoking has been prevalent for a half century or more, about 80 to 90% of cases are attributable to this avoidable cause. Fortunately, some of these countries are now experiencing a downturn in lung cancer mortality rates, particularly among males, reflecting trends of increasing quitting and declining initiation. In spite of the extensive epidemiological research directed at lung cancer, key issues remain under investigation and this presentation will provide syntheses of the evidence related to these issues: •The changing trends of lung cancer histological types.•The consequences of changing characteristics of cigarettes.•Diet and gender as modifiers of the risk of smoking.•The genetic determinants of lung cancer risk in smokers.•The extent and causes of lung cancer in never smokers.",1556-0864 1556-1380,-1,openalex,1722,,,,404

Among various analytical techniques, toxicology and epidemiology are of major importance for this purpose. Their possibilities and limitations will be reported here. For example, exact identification of the different pathogen asbestos fibers blue and white asbestos (crocidolite and chysotile) in external air, in lung tissue and in BAL is only possible with time consuming and expensive measuring techniques such as energy dispersive roentgen microanalysis and diffraction analysis in combination with scanning electron microscopy and transelectron microscopy examinations. Using modern chemical trace analysis we are in a position to quantify non-fibriform carcinogens in BAL, which may possibly multiply the asbestos-induced risk. Only in cancer types related predominantly to certain air pollutions (i.e. pulmonary cancer and cigarette smoking/pleura mesothelioma and asbestos fibers), epidemiological procedure such as the evaluation of official death certificates offer clues of the effect of one single carcinogen. Investigations in experimental toxicology have yielded important results regarding the impact of geometry, surface structure and chemical composition of asbestos fibers on their fibrogen and blastomatous properties. In his context, it is the concern of comparative clinical diagnostic and experimental pathology (e.g. environmental pathology) to establish the extent of correlation between experimentally induced morphological reaction patterns and known human pathologic findings and also to assess how far dose-effect relations found in animal experiments can be transferred to humans. Choosing the appropriate risk model is a decisive factor for the evaluation of asbestos-related cancer risk based on these experimental and epidemiologic data. Lineal risk extrapolation is discussed critically. In comparison to other known cancer-induced lung contaminants the risk caused by asbestos fibers in environmental-relevant concentrations was found to be comparatively minor.",0341-3055,manual_review,embase,1242,,,,405

New analyses in the form of a relative risk model confirmed the strong decreasing effect with time since exposure that was observed earlier. In addition, a significant dependence on age at exposure was observed. This pattern of decreasing relative risk with increasing age at irradiation is consistent with observations in A-bomb survivors and irradiated patients. Similar analyses were performed for the two most frequent histological types of bronchogenic carcinoma, epidermoid and small cell. The general pattern of the risk for these two types was found to be similar to that for lung cancer overall. Nevertheless, differences were observed between these two types in the magnitude of the risk coefficients and in the latent period. The effect of radon exposure was found to be stronger but briefer for the small cell type. The effect of smoking was not examined in this study, as such data were not available.",0033-7587,-1,embase,1205,,,,407

The U.S. National Research Council has recently completed a comprehensive evaluation of the health risks of residential exposure to radon and developed models for projecting radon lung cancer risks to the general population. This analysis suggests that radon may play a role in the etiology of 10-15% of all lung cancer cases in the United States, although these estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty. In this article, we present a detailed analysis of uncertainty and variability in estimates of lung cancer risk due to residential exposure to radon. We use a general framework for the analysis of uncertainty and variability that we developed previously. Specifically, we focus on estimates of the age-specific excess relative risk (ERR) and lifetime relative risk (LRR), both of which vary substantially among individuals. We also consider estimates of the population attributable risk (PAR), which reflects the proportion of the lung cancer burden attributable to radon. Variability in the ERR and LRR is largely determined by variability in residential exposure levels and in the dosimetric K-factor used to extrapolate from occupational to environmental settings. Uncertainty in the ERR and LRR is due to uncertainty in the model parameters, notably those reflecting the carcinogenic potency of radon and the modifying effect of attained age. Uncertainty in the PAR is determined by uncertainty about the values of the parameters in the risk models used to estimate the PAR. Uncertainty in radon levels in homes and the dosimetric K-factor contribute comparatively little to uncertainty in the PAR. These results suggest that reduction in uncertainty about the PAR for radon induced lung cancer can only be achieved if more reliable risk projection models can be developed.",0077-8923,-1,"pubmed, embase","1413, 1211",,,,409

Methodologically, it is based on case-control studies nested within two Czech cohort studies of nearly 11,000 miners followed-up for mortality in 1952-2010 and nearly 12,000 inhabitants exposed to high levels of radon in homes, with mortality follow-up in 1960-2010.

Three or four control subjects have been individually matched to cases according to sex, year of birth, and age. The combined effect from radon and smoking is analyzed in terms of geometric mixture models of which the additive and multiplicative models are special cases. The resulting models are relatively close to the additive interaction (mixing parameter 0.2 and 0.3 in the occupational and residential studies, respectively). The impact of the resulting model in the residential radon study is illustrated by estimates of lifetime risk in hypothetical populations of smokers and non-smokers.

By the end of 1975, 4463 men and 84 women had died. Among men, the overall excess mortality, 1926-75 was 2% at Asbestos and 10% at Thetford Mines, much the dustier region.

If the only subjects studied had been the 1904 men with at least 20 years' employment in the lower dust concentrations, averaging 6.6 million particles per cubic foot (or about 20 fibres/cc), excess mortality would not have been considered statistically significant, except for pneumoconiosis.

Extensive measurements of radon concentrations in homes have shown that although concentrations vary widely, radon is universally present, raising concerns that radon in homes has a finite possibility of increasing lung-cancer risk for the general population. Method: A total of 210 residential buildings (30 per city) with commonest combination of covering materials for walls, ceilings and floors in some cities in South-western Nigeria were investigated using RAD7 radon detector. The commonest combination of covering materials were (A): paint, paint, carpet; (B): paint fiber board, plastic tiles; (C): paint, fiber board, ceramic tiles for walls, ceilings and floors respectively. Result: The mean indoor radon concentration measured ranged from 54.03Bq m-3 to 65.01 Bq m-3 for all the combinations investigated from city to city and were found to be higher than the world average of 40 Bq m-3 but lower than the recommended action level of 200 Bq m-3 set by International Committee on Radiological Protection(ICRP). A test of significance carried out using analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed that there is significance difference (p < 0.05) in the radon concentration from one location to another and among different combinations of covering materials. The estimated lung cancer risk which lie between 13 per million person per year (MPY) to 63 MPY for USEPA, ICRP and UNSCEAR risk models were very low and comparable with data from many countries of the world according to UNSCEAR (1993). The excess relative risks (ERR) increases cumulatively with age up to 54 years and declines discontinuously for ages 55 upward for both the duration and concentration models. At age 75 and above, there is no noticeable difference in the increase in death rate between the duration and concentration models adopted by BEIR VI for all the combinations of covering materials. Conclusion: This result showed vividly that the risk of developing lung cancer from radon exposure in residential buildings investigated increases with radon concentration and exposure duration with no known threshold concentration below which radon exposure presents no risk.",2249-9571,abstract_added,openalex,1653,,,,416

However, most lung cancer is caused by smoking, which raises a dual problem of deriving Rn-progeny cancer risk estimates from miner populations who, in large part, are smokers and applying these estimates to the general population whose lung cancer risk, in large part, is determined by smoking habits. We examine current risk estimates for Rn-progeny-induced lung cancer using a cohort life table methodology. Estimates of lifetime probability of dying of lung cancer, average loss in life expectancy due to premature lung cancer death, and loss in life expectancy per premature lung cancer death are calculated for the general population for 1969 and 1978, nonsmokers, and smokers. These calculations demonstrate that such risk estimates are affected by smoking, and by trends in smoking habits, in several ways. Major smoking-related factors in this interaction are the proportion of smokers in the mining population used to derive lung cancer risk estimates, the proportion of smokers in the ""general"" population, and the assumed interaction (additive or multiplicative) between lung cancer risk, Rn-progeny exposure, and smoking history. At this time the data are not sufficient to recommend one particular modeling approach. However, our evaluation demonstrates that broad statements about Rn-progeny lung cancer risk such as ""x cancers/10(6) person working level month,"" while informative, are incomplete without further specification.

Our goal was to estimate the prevalence and level of occupational exposure to radon, and to estimate the current lung cancer burden caused by radon exposure in Canadian workplaces. Methods Highly exposed (i.e. underground) workers were assigned exposure proportions at the national level using CAREX methodology. Exposure for the indoor working population was estimated using province-specific radon measurements from the Canadian federal building survey (n=12 870 samples). The proportion of workers exposed to specific ranges of radon (50-100, 100-150, 150-200, 200-400, 400-800,>800 Bq/m3) were calculated and we assigned the midpoint of the range as the average radon concentration for each exposure group. For the >800 Bq/m3 category, the province-specific mean of measure-ments>800 Bq/m3 was assigned. The above exposure assessment was applied to a population model of the historical Canadian labour force and exposures between 1961 and 2001 (the risk exposure period) were considered as contributing to cancer cases in 2011. The BEIR VI exposure-age-concentration model was used to assign relative risks by exposure category. The population attributable fraction was calculated using Levin's equation. Results There were an estimated 4.4 million indoor workers and 26 000 highly exposed workers exposed to radon during the risk exposure period. Nearly 80% of these workers were exposed below 50 Bq/m3 (half the WHO reference level). Combining the indoor and highly exposed workers, we calculated that 0.80% of lung cancers are attributable to occupational radon exposure; this equates to 188 lung cancer cases per year. Conclusions Ours was the first study to use a data-driven approach to estimate radon exposure and lung cancer burden for indoor workers.

We explore two methods to estimate this burden using mesothelioma deaths as a proxy for asbestos exposure.Methods: From the follow-up of 55 asbestos cohorts, we estimated ratios of (i) absolute number of asbestos-related lung cancers to mesothelioma deaths; (ii) excess lung cancer relative risk (%) to mesothelioma mortality per 1000 non-asbestos-related deaths. Results: Ratios varied by asbestos type; there were a mean 0.7 (95% confidence interval 0.5, 1.0) asbestos-related lung cancers per mesothelioma death in crocidolite cohorts (n=6 estimates), 6.1 (3.6, 10.5) in chrysotile (n=16), 4.0 (2.8, 5.9) in amosite (n=4) and 1.9 (1.4, 2.6) in mixed asbestos fibre cohorts (n=31). In a population with 2 mesothelioma deaths per 1000 deaths at ages 40-84 years (e.g., US men), the estimated lung cancer population attributable fraction due to mixed asbestos was estimated to be 4.0%. Conclusion: All types of asbestos fibres kill at least twice as many people through lung cancer than through mesothelioma, except for crocidolite. For chrysotile, widely consumed today, asbestos-related lung cancers cannot be robustly estimated from few mesothelioma deaths and the latter cannot be used to infer no excess risk of lung or other cancers. © 2012 Cancer Research UK.",1532-1827 and 0007-0920,-1,embase,1123,,,,423

This study estimates the attributable fraction (AF) of lung cancers due to workplace ETS, and is part of a larger effort to estimate the current burden of occupational cancers in Canada. Methods The AF calculation requires estimates of the proportion of workers ever exposed (PrE) during the risk exposure period (REP, 1961 - 2000) and the relative risk (RR). To estimate the PrE, the proportion of never-smokers who were exposed to workplace ETS was calculated from Canadian data sources, then combined with historical Canadian employment statistics, labour force data and survival probabilities. Exposure duration was estimated using data from a national case-control study, and used to assign RRs based upon a dose-response relationship reported in the literature. We accounted for never-smoking lung cancer cases, using rates observed among never-smokers in a large US study (CPS-II). Results The proportion of never-smokers in men showed an increasing trend during the REP while in women the proportion decreased slightly. A drop in the proportion of workers exposed to workplace ETS was found in the 80's and 90's. Approximately 7.2 million workers were ever exposed to workplace ETS during the REP, of which half were female. Estimated AFs for ETSrelated lung cancers were: 0.6% for males, and 0.5% for females, which equates to 74 lung cancer cases in men and 57 in women. This translates to AFs of 11.8% and 5.8% among never-smoking men and women, respectively. Conclusions Lung cancer attributable to workplace ETS was low in the Canadian population because a large proportion of lung cancer cases occurred among current or former smokers. When only considering the burden among never-smokers, we found a relatively large proportion of cases attributable to workplace ETS.",1470-7926,-1,embase,"1071, 1707",,,,424

The scope and impact of exposure among Canadian workers have not been assessed. Our study estimated occupational radon exposure in Canada and its associated lung cancer burden. Methods Exposed workers were identified among the working population during the risk exposure period (1961–2001) using data from the Canadian Census and Labour Force Survey. Exposure levels were assigned based on 12,865 workplace radon measurements for indoor workers and assumed to be 1800 mg/m 3 for underground workers. Lung cancer risks were calculated using the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) VI exposure-age-concentration model.

An updated database of national radon exposures for 66 countries allows the global burden of lung cancer mortality attributable to radon to be estimated. OBJECTIVE: Our goal was to estimate the global population attributable burden of lung cancer mortality in 2012 from residential radon. METHODS: Estimates of the population attributable risk (PAR) of lung cancer mortality from radon were determined using the attributable fraction approach, using three models for excess relative risk of lung cancer from radon. RESULTS: The estimates of the median PAR of lung cancer mortality from residential radon in 2012 for the 66 countries having representative national radon surveys were consistent, as 16.5%, 14.4%, and 13.6% for the exposure–age–concentration (EAC) model (BEIR VI), the Hunter model, and the Kreuzer model, respectively. The mean PAR using the EAC model ranged from 4.2% (95% CI: 0.9, 11.7) for Japan, to 29.3% (95% CI: 22.9, 35.7) for Armenia, with a median for the 66 countries of 16.5%. Radon-attributable lung cancer deaths for all 66 countries totaled 226,057 in 2012 and represent a median of 3.0% of total cancer deaths. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent findings between the three models used to estimate excess relative risks of lung cancer from radon, and between the attributable fraction methodology and the life table analysis, confirm that residential radon is responsible for a substantial proportion of lung cancer mortality worldwide.",1552-9924 and 0091-6765,-1,embase,1061,,,,426

Lung cancer risk estimates for exposure to radon progeny in smoker and non-smoker populations are obtained by applying the same risk model to each population group, thereby assuming the joint effects of smoking and exposure to radon progeny are multiplicative. However, in miners, joint relative risks (RR) for the two exposures are most consistent with an intermediate relationship between multiplicative and additive, so that the present approach likely results in an overestimate of risk in smokers and an underestimate of risk in nonsmokers. Lubin et al. (National Institutes of Health Publication No. 94-3644, 1994) present an ad hoc approach for adjusting risk models to incorporate smoking status. The approach is based on the relative magnitude of the effects of radon progeny in smokers and nonsmokers and therefore may not be applicable to non-miner populations if the proportion of smokers and the RR for smoking differ. We show that the modification can be derived explicitly by assuming an arithmetic mixture model for the joint RR for smoking and exposure to radon progeny. In this way, smoking parameters in the population of interest (the proportion of smokers and the RR of smoking) can be used directly to adjust radon progeny risk models and obtain risk estimates that are specific for smokers and nonsmokers. With an intermediate RR relationship for smoking and radon progeny, the attributable percentage of lung cancer deaths from residential radon may be twofold greater in non-smokers than in smokers.",0033-7587,-1,"pubmed, embase","1444, 1236",,,,427

Although radon levels measured in homes are normally substantially lower, there is concern about the presence of a known lung carcinogen in a residential setting. Using national survey data on radon concentrations in homes in the former West Germany, the proportion and absolute numbers of lung cancer deaths attributable to radon are estimated. As lung cancer risk models derived directly from residential radon studies are not yet available, the risk model developed recently by Lubin et al. from a joint analysis of 11 underground miners' studies is applied. For an estimate of the impact of smoking on radon-attributable lung cancers, three different approaches are used and compared. Our analysis shows that after adjusting for dosimetry differences between mines and homes about 7% of all lung cancer deaths in the western part of Germany may be due to residential radon. This corresponds to a total of about 2000 deaths (95% CI: 500-8200), 400 in females and 1600 in males. Adjusting for the intermediate relationship for smoking and radon, the attributable risk is estimated to be about 4-7% for smokers and 14-22% in non-smokers.

These studies aimed at investigating the combined effects of radon and smoking on lung cancer risk. A pooled analysis of individual data of the three studies is presented. Methods: The pooled data set includes 1476 cases and 3389 matched controls. Cumulated radon exposure during employment was obtained from measurements or a job exposure matrix. Smoking habits were determined from medical archives and questionnaires. Analysis was performed by conditional logistic regression using a linear excess relative risk model. Results: Smoking status was established for 1046 cases and 2492 controls. Ninety four percent of cases and 76% of controls were ex- or current smokers. Mean five-year lagged cumulated radon exposure was 335 Working Level Months (WLM) for cases and 211 WLM for controls. The excess relative risk per 100 WLM adjusted for smoking was 0.79 (95% confidence-interval: 0.44-1.41). Lung cancer excess relative risk was higher among non-smokers than among smokers and the results suggest a sub-multiplicative interaction between smoking and radon exposure on lung cancer mortality risk. Conclusions: This collaborative study is the largest uranium miner case-control study on lung cancer with smoking information in Europe. It confirms the persistence of radon effect on lung cancer risk when smoking is taken into account.

Preclinical studies of STs have suggested antileukemic activity in myeloid neoplasms including myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) (Jang et al, 2019; Li et al, 2003; Burke & Kukoly, 2008) and several effects of STs including antiproliferative and proapoptotic effects, decreasing release of several growth factors, and antiangiogenetic effects have led to the perception that STs could prevent the development of fibrotic diseases(Hasselbalch & Riley, 2006; Clendening & Penn, 2012). In this study we aimed to investigate the association between ST use and risk of MPNs. METHODS We conducted a population-based nested case-control study comparing ST use among patients diagnosed with MPN between 2010 and 2018 and a matched population (without MPN) to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for MPN in association to ST use. We utilized and linked five nationwide Danish health registers to collect exposure data and covariates for adjusted analyses. Cases were identified using the National Chronic Myeloid Neoplasia Registry covering >90% of MPN cases in Denmark (Bak et al, 2016) and controls were selected by incidence density sampling (five to one) from the general Danish population. The index date was defined as the first date of the MPN diagnosis. The exposure assessment of ST was identified using Danish National Prescription Registry. Ever-use of ST was defined as having redeemed at least one prescription of ST prior to the index date, never-use was defined as no filled prescription of ST prior to the index date, and long-term use was defined as ≥5 years treatment with ST, assuming a daily intake of one tablet of the prescribed dose and added 25% additional days to account for variations and minor incompliance. Conditional logistic regression was used to obtain ORs provided with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for 1) analysis adjusted for the matching variables by study design (age, sex, and index date) and 2) fully adjusted ORs (aORs) (see footnote in Table 2 for adjusted variables). Additionally, we used a lag-time of 12 months before index data to disregard information on covariates. The same lag-time was applied to the exposure assessment for STs to avoid reverse causation. RESULTS The study population comprised 3,816 cases and 19,080 controls and the characteristics and exposure patterns are given in Table 1. Among cases 34.9% were categorized as ever users of STs compared to 33.5% among controls resulting in a OR of 1.07 (95% CI, 0.99-1.16) and an aOR for MPN of 0.87 (0.80-0.96). Overall, 17.2% of cases and 19.0% of controls were long-term users yielding a crude OR of 0.90 (0.81-1.00) and an aOR for MPN of 0.72 (0.64-0.81). Analyses using cumulative time of exposure to STs revealed a clear dose-dependent response with decreasing aORs with longer treatment duration (<1 years: aOR 1.15 (0.97-1.36); 1-4.99 years: aOR 0.96 [0.85-1.08]; 5-9.99 years: aOR 0.83 [0.72-0.95]; ≥10 years: aOR 0.63 [0.54-0.74]). Analyses of the association between long-term use of STs and MPN for age subgroups revealed a null estimate for age <60 years with an aOR of 0.80 (0.52-1.25), whereas age 60-75 years and >75 years revealed a significant negative association with an aOR of 0.77 (0.65-0.91) and 0.65 (0.54-0.78), respectively. Subgroup analysis for male sex was associated with decreased odds of MPN after long-term ST use with an aOR of 0.57 (0.47-0.68) whereas this was not seen for female with an aOR of 0.88 (0.75-1.04). Furthermore, long-term use of ST was associated with decreased odds of myelofibrosis (aOR 0.60 [0.44-0.82]), polycythemia vera (PV) (aOR 0.73 [0.59-0.89]) and MPN unclassifiable (MPN-U) (aOR 0.52 [0.39-0.71]), whereas a neutral association with essential thrombocythemia (ET) were observed (aOR 0.89 [0.72-1.10]). CONCLUSION To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the association between ST use and risk of MPNs. A protective effect of STs on the risk of developing MPN with an aOR of 0.87 (0.80-0.96) was demonstrated, primarily driven by long-term use and a strong interaction by gender, where the association was particularly strong in males. Subgroup analyses revealed a protective effect for PV, MF and MPN-U, however not for ET. Further preclinical and clinical studies on this subject is warranted.

Moreover, the construction sector was included. the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) was estimated from the meta-analysis of the literature review. The ratio lung cancer to mesothelioma attributable cases was estimated by occupational sector from the Italian cohorts. For the construction sector, the ratio lung cancer to mesothelioma cases was estimated within the exposed workers estimated by CAREX (1990-1993). The ratios were applied to the mesothelioma cases registered at the ReNaM for the 2010-2015 period, to obtain a national estimate of lung cancer cases attributable to occupational exposure to asbestos. the meta-analytical SMR for lung cancer in men varied between 1.05 (asphalt roll) and 2.36 (insulation). The mean risk for all sectors was 1.37 in men and 1.60 in women. It increased in cohorts with latency higher than 20 years. Significant risks were observed in asbestos-cement (both genders), construction, and mining sectors. There was a mean of 1.1, 2.7, and 2.8 lung cancer deaths per mesothelioma death in the cement-asbestos, harbour, and construction sectors, respectively.

We build separate risk models for current and former smokers using 169,035 ever smokers from the multicenter European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) and considered a model for never smokers. The data set was split into independent training and test sets. Lung cancer incidence was modeled using survival analysis, stratifying by age started smoking, and for former smokers, also smoking duration. Other risk factors considered were smoking intensity, 10 occupational/environmental exposures previously implicated with lung cancer, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms at two loci identified by genome-wide association studies of lung cancer. Individual risk in the test set was measured by the predicted probability of lung cancer incidence in the year preceding last follow-up time, predictive accuracy was measured by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC). Using smoking information alone gave good predictive accuracy: the AUC and 95% confidence interval in ever smokers was 0.843 (0.810-0.875), the Bach model applied to the same data gave an AUC of 0.775 (0.737-0.813).

We describe how CAREX has been used to estimate the burden of occupational cancer and contribute to national occupational surveillance. Methods: For the burden of occupational cancer study, CAREX Canada provided estimates of exposure prevalence for 29 carcinogens and exposure levels for 15 carcinogens, taking into account sex, province, and industry and occupation at a more detailed level than previous CAREX projects. Exposure data were used with published quantitative exposure-response estimates, historical employment trends (census data, 1961-2011), and cancer incidence and mortality data from national registries to calculate attributable fractions. For the occupational cancer surveillance study, job/industry-exposure matrixes were applied to a cohort identified from the 1991 Canadian census and linked to national tumor registry and other databases. Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Wood dust is used here as an example. Results: Approximately 700,000 workers were ever exposed to wood dust (mostly softwood) nationally. The proportion of sinonasal cancer due to wood dust exposure was estimated as 7.5% for men and 0.5% for women. For nasopharyngeal cancers these figures were 7.6% for men and 0.4% for women. In the surveillance study, woodworkers with high levels of wood dust exposure had evidence of a high risk of sinonasal cancer (HR=2.6, CI=0.6-10.4), while higher risks of lung cancer (HR=1.3, CI=1.1-1.5) and mesothelioma (HR=2.6, CI=1.3-5.1) were observed among workers with moderately exposure to asbestos and silica .

In ex- smokers, the relative risk gradually decreased from 5 years after smoking cessation but this decrease was much less pronounced in ex-pipe smokers than in ex-cigarette smokers. High relative risks were obtained for small cell and squamous cell carcinomas. For adenocarcinoma the relative risk was considerably lower but still significantly increased.

Studies of miners show that exposure to radon decay products causes lung cancer. Consequently, it is of public health interest to estimate accurately the consequences of daily, low-level exposure in homes to this known carcinogen. Epidemiologic studies of residential radon exposure are burdened by an inability to estimate exposure accurately, low total exposure, and subsequent small excess risks. As a result, the studies have been inconclusive to date. Estimates of the hazard posed by residential radon have been based on analyses of data on miners, with recent estimates based on a pooling of four occupational cohort studies of miners, including 360 lung cancer deaths. To more fully describe the lung cancer risk in radon-exposed miners, we pooled original data from 11 studies of radon-exposed underground miners, conducted a comprehensive analysis, and developed models for estimating radon-associated lung cancer risk. We pooled original data from 11 cohort studies of radon-exposed underground miners, including 65,000 men and more than 2700 lung cancer deaths, and fit various relative risk (RR) regression models. The RR relationship for cumulative radon progeny exposure was consistently linear in the range of miner exposures, suggesting that exposures at lower levels, such as in homes, would carry some risk. The exposure-response trend for never-smokers was threefold the trend for smokers, indicating a greater RR for exposure in never-smokers. The RR from exposure diminished with time since the exposure occurred. For equal total exposure, exposures of long duration (and low rate) were more harmful than exposures of short duration (and high rate). In the miners, about 40% of all lung cancer deaths may be due to radon progeny exposure, 70% of lung cancer deaths in never-smokers, and 39% of lung cancer deaths in smokers. In the United States, 10% of all lung cancer deaths might be due to indoor radon exposure, 11% of lung cancer deaths in smokers, and 30% of lung cancer deaths in never-smokers. This risk model estimates that reducing radon in all homes exceeding the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency's recommended action level may reduce lung cancer deaths about 2%-4%. These estimates should be interpreted with caution, because concomitant exposures of miners to agents such as arsenic or diesel exhaust may modify the radon effect and, when considered together with other differences between homes and mines, might reduce the generalizability of findings in miners.",0027-8874,title_duplicate,"pubmed, embase","1441, 1235",1,,0,448

The aim of the study was to investigate the asbestos-associated risk of lung cancer according to histological type of cancer, lobe of origin, pulmonary concentration, and type of amphibole fibers and also to estimate the etiologic fraction of asbestos for lung cancer. METHODS. The pulmonary concentration of asbestos fibers in 113 surgically treated male lung cancer patients and 297 autopsy cases among men serving as referents was determined by scanning electron microscopy. The age- and smoking-adjusted odds ratios of lung cancer were calculated according to pulmonary fiber concentration for all lung cancer types, sqaumous-cell carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma and for the lower-lobe and the upper- and middle-lobe cancers. RESULTS. The risk of lung cancer was increased according to the pulmonary concentration of asbestos fibers (f) of 1.0 to 4.99 106 f. g(-l) [odds ratio (OR) 1.7] and ≥5.0 106 f. g-1 (OR 5.3). The odds ratios associated with fiber concentrations of ≥1.0.106 f. g-1 were higher for adenocarcinoma (OR 4.0) than for squamous-cell carcinoma (OR 1.6). The asbestos-associated risk was higher for lower lobe tumors than for upper lobe tumors. The risk estimates for anthophyllite and crocidolite-amosite fibers were similar, except for the risk of squamous-cell carcinoma. An etiologic fraction of 19% was calculated for asbestos among male surgical lung cancer patients in the greater Helsinki area. CONCLUSIONS. Past exposure to asbestos is a significant factor in the etiology of lung cancer in southern Finland.

The European pooled analysis of indoor radon studies estimates an excess relative risk of 8% (16% after correction for measurement uncertainties) per 100 Bq m(-3) indoor radon concentration. Here, we determine the population attributable fraction (PAF) for lung cancer due to residential radon based on this risk estimate for Switzerland and Germany. Based on regionally stratified radon data, the PAF was calculated following the World Health Organization concept of global burden of disease, compared to a realistic baseline radon concentration equal to the outdoor concentration. Lifetable approaches were used taking smoking and sex into account. Measurement error corrections were applied to both risk estimates and the radon distribution. In Switzerland, the average indoor radon concentration is 78 Bq m(-3), resulting in a PAF of 8.3%. Therefore, 169 male lung cancer deaths and 62 deaths in women can be attributed to residential radon per year. For Germany, the average indoor radon concentration is 49 Bq m(-3), corresponding to a PAF of 5.0% (1,422 male and 474 female deaths annually). In both countries, a large regional variation in the PAF was observed due to regional differences in radon concentrations and population structure. Both calculations show a strong dependency on the risk model used. Risk models based on miner studies result in higher PAF estimates than risk models based on indoor radon studies due to different assumptions regarding exposures received more than 35 years ago. The use of a non-zero baseline radon concentration also contributes to the lower PAF estimates reported here. Although the estimates of the population attributable fraction of residential radon presented here are lower than previously reported estimates, the risk is still one of the most widespread environmental hazards. Radon monitoring and radon reduction programs are therefore important issues for environmental public health management.",1538-5159,-1,pubmed,1366,1,,0,453
